        "1) There is limited evidence for use of superficial or deep heat to obtain clinically important long term outcomes for musculoskeletal conditions. While
there is some evidence of short-term pain relief for heat, the addition of heat should be supported by evidence and used to facilitate an active treatment
program. A carefully designed active treatment plan has a greater impact on pain, mobility, function and quality of life. There is emerging evidence
that passive treatment strategies can harm patients by exacerbating fears and anxiety about being physically active when in pain, which can prolong
recovery, increase costs and increase the risk of exposure to invasive and costly interventions such as injections or surgery"<br><br><a href="http://integrity.apta.org/ChoosingWisely/5Things/" target="_blank">From Five Things Physical Therapists
