1
00:00:01.792 --> 00:00:04.352
So what is an ECG or electrocardiogram

2
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.888
It is recording

3
00:00:06.144 --> 00:00:07.936
The electrical activity within the heart

4
00:00:08.448 --> 00:00:09.216
What triggers contraction

5
00:00:09.472 --> 00:00:09.984
Cardiac muscle

6
00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:12.544
What start with just a little physiology

7
00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:14.592
I'm going to keep this very brief

8
00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:15.360
Very simple

9
00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:18.176
But you can spend time on your own learning physiology

10
00:00:18.432 --> 00:00:18.944
The different Acts

11
00:00:19.968 --> 00:00:20.480
Pacemaker

12
00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:21.504
And working cell

13
00:00:22.528 --> 00:00:24.064
Let's imagine that this is a row of

14
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.832
Cardiac muscle

15
00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:26.624
Each cell is

16
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.392
Polarized

17
00:00:28.672 --> 00:00:29.696
The cell interior

18
00:00:29.952 --> 00:00:31.488
Has a net negative charge relative

19
00:00:31.744 --> 00:00:32.256
The outside

20
00:00:35.328 --> 00:00:38.656
Voltage-gated ion channels in the my site membranes will open up

21
00:00:39.168 --> 00:00:40.704
Allowing positively charged ions

22
00:00:41.216 --> 00:00:41.984
Is sodium calcium

23
00:00:42.496 --> 00:00:43.008
Enter the cell

24
00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:49.408
Because he's ions are positively charged as a build up within the my site they will give the cell interior a net positive

25
00:00:49.664 --> 00:00:51.200
Charge relative to cell exterior

26
00:00:51.968 --> 00:00:56.576
This is known as depolarization because it was Polar Ice arrest and now is no longer polarized

27
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.976
The cells are connected via Gap Junctions which allowed ions or charge to spread from cell to cell

28
00:01:03.488 --> 00:01:05.536
When the new cell reaches threshold

29
00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:11.680
The process repeats is voltage gated ion channels in its cell membrane open allowing the influx of sodium and calcium

30
00:01:12.448 --> 00:01:18.080
The Gap Junctions allow charge to spread efficiently from cell-to-cell causing a wave of depolarization

31
00:01:19.104 --> 00:01:23.456
This wave propagates throughout the heart in an orderly fashion as an electrical impulse

32
00:01:24.224 --> 00:01:30.368
The sum of all electrical force is generated by every cell in the heart is plotted as voltage versus time and this

33
00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:32.160
Is plot is called an ECG

34
00:01:33.696 --> 00:01:39.328
You may be wondering how ions moving across a myocyte membrane can cause the modify balls to shorten or contract

35
00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:46.240
Remember we aren't talking about Action potentials moving through a motor neuron which uses neurotransmitters to cause muscle contraction

36
00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:48.032
We talk about action potentials

37
00:01:48.544 --> 00:01:51.360
Spreading via Gap Junctions throughout the cardiac cells themselves

38
00:01:51.872 --> 00:01:55.712
Including pacemaker cells specialized conducting cells and the cardiac muscle cells

39
00:01:56.992 --> 00:02:01.600
During cardiac Action potentials there's an inward flow of calcium from outside the cell as we just discussed

40
00:02:02.624 --> 00:02:05.184
This calcium open story Imogene receptor

41
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.768
Causing the release of even more calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum

42
00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:10.304
Into the myocyte cytoplasm

43
00:02:10.816 --> 00:02:13.888
A phenomenon known as calcium dependent calcium release

44
00:02:14.656 --> 00:02:19.520
The calcium binds to troponin which unlocked tropomyosin which allows a cross-linking of actin

45
00:02:20.288 --> 00:02:23.104
This causes contraction or shortening of the myofibrils

46
00:02:23.872 --> 00:02:27.712
If more calcium into the cytoplasm more myofibrils will be active

47
00:02:27.968 --> 00:02:31.296
Does the amount of calcium corresponds to the force of contraction

48
00:02:32.576 --> 00:02:38.208
The initial influx of calcium during the action potential is not sufficient to call sustained ventricular contraction

49
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.864
So calcium dependent calcium release is necessary to ensure that the heart can contract and eject enough blood to Keep Us Alive

50
00:02:46.144 --> 00:02:49.728
The main point is that action potentials moving through the conduction system

51
00:02:49.984 --> 00:02:52.800
Are the initial trigger for the cardiac muscle cells to contract

52
00:02:53.312 --> 00:02:56.896
Therefore when you're looking at electrical activity on Macy G

53
00:02:57.152 --> 00:02:58.944
You can be certain that it is coupled

54
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.016
Physical contraction of The myocardium under normal circumstances

55
00:03:03.552 --> 00:03:09.440
If the ECG shows a fast rate than you know that there's a high frequency of impulses causing the heart to pump rapidly

56
00:03:10.208 --> 00:03:14.816
If an ECG shows no organized electrical activity such as ventricular fibrillation

57
00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:19.680
Then you know that the patient's heart is not pumping effectively an emergent resuscitation is needed

58
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.848
Normally a wave of action potentials begins in the sinoatrial node or SA node

59
00:03:27.104 --> 00:03:29.920
Located in the superior region of the right atrium

60
00:03:30.688 --> 00:03:32.992
This wave then spread throughout both Atria

61
00:03:33.248 --> 00:03:35.808
Causing atrial contraction that squeezes blood

62
00:03:38.112 --> 00:03:41.952
The Atria and ventricles are electrically isolated from each other by fibrous tissue

63
00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:47.328
So the only path that the impulse can travel is through the atrioventricular node or AV node

64
00:03:48.352 --> 00:03:51.680
For this reason the AV node is considered the GateKeeper

65
00:03:51.936 --> 00:03:53.216
Between atrial impulses

66
00:03:53.472 --> 00:03:54.496
And regular impulse

67
00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:01.664
This gatekeeper function of the AV node is crucial for limiting the rate of ventricular contraction during atrial arrhythmias such

68
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.688
What is atrial fibrillation

69
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.968
Good morning that later

70
00:04:05.504 --> 00:04:08.832
When the impulse reaches the AV node it encounters a conduction delay

71
00:04:09.088 --> 00:04:13.696
Which ensures that the Atria have fully contracted and filled the ventricles with blood

72
00:04:13.952 --> 00:04:15.232
Prior to ventricular contraction

73
00:04:16.768 --> 00:04:19.839
From there the impulse travels rapidly through the bundle of His

74
00:04:20.095 --> 00:04:23.167
Which splits into the left bundle branch and right bundle branch

75
00:04:23.679 --> 00:04:25.215
And then reaches the purkinje fibers

76
00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:31.103
The purkinje fibers stimulate ventricular myocytes causing Chris ventricular contraction

77
00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:38.783
This organized conduction pathway causes The myocardium to contract in a coordinated manner that squeezes blood through the pulmonary

78
00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.111
Artery to the lungs or through the aorta to the rest of the body

79
00:04:45.183 --> 00:04:46.975
So let's talk about the basics of an ECG

80
00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:52.351
The very first step it's connector patients the ECG machine via 10 wire electrodes

81
00:04:52.863 --> 00:04:54.655
You place a piece of stickers on the patient

82
00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:56.703
Four on the limbs and 6 on the chest

83
00:04:57.215 --> 00:05:00.031
And then you clap on the wires and connect into the ECG machine

84
00:05:01.055 --> 00:05:07.199
By recording electrical activity between these 10 electrodes the ECG machine produces 12 leads that give you info

85
00:05:07.455 --> 00:05:09.759
Information about electrical forces in various directions

86
00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:12.575
What start with the limb leads

87
00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.183
The right leg electrode is not measured but is used as the electrical ground

88
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:24.095
The other three limb electrodes are used to reduce the six limb leads which give you information about the patient's heart in the frontal

89
00:05:24.351 --> 00:05:24.863
Playing

90
00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:27.935
The limb leads are bipolar leads

91
00:05:28.191 --> 00:05:31.775
So they measure current from the negative electrode towards the positive electrode

92
00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:34.335
Ligue 1

93
00:05:34.847 --> 00:05:37.919
It's from the right on electrodes the left on electron

94
00:05:39.967 --> 00:05:43.295
Lead II is from the right arm to the left leg

95
00:05:45.343 --> 00:05:46.111
Lead 3

96
00:05:46.367 --> 00:05:48.415
Is from the left arm to the left leg

97
00:05:50.463 --> 00:05:55.071
Lead AVR is from the average of the other limb electrodes towards the right arm

98
00:05:56.095 --> 00:05:57.119
Lead AVL

99
00:05:57.375 --> 00:06:00.703
Is from the average of the other limb electrodes towards the left arm

100
00:06:01.471 --> 00:06:06.079
And Lead avf is the average of the other limb electrodes towards the left leg

101
00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.223
This is what the first half in ECG looks like

102
00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:13.503
With the 6 Lindley

103
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:14.783
You can see

104
00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:15.551
The first column

105
00:06:16.063 --> 00:06:17.599
Shows leads 1 2 and 3

106
00:06:17.855 --> 00:06:21.183
And the second column shows leads AVR AVL and APF

107
00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:24.255
Again these 6 leads

108
00:06:24.511 --> 00:06:25.279
Provide you with information

109
00:06:25.791 --> 00:06:26.303
Frontal plane

110
00:06:27.327 --> 00:06:28.607
Is helpful show these leads

111
00:06:28.863 --> 00:06:29.887
Axial reference

112
00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:31.167
Shown here

113
00:06:31.423 --> 00:06:33.471
Which will be important when we later discussed how did

114
00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:34.495
Determine the axe

115
00:06:36.543 --> 00:06:42.687
Nothing discussed how the limb leads provide information about the frontal plane we're going to talk about the chest leads also referred to as a pre

116
00:06:42.943 --> 00:06:43.455
Recorded leads

117
00:06:44.735 --> 00:06:49.343
The six chest electrodes produce the six chest leads known as V1 through V6

118
00:06:49.855 --> 00:06:53.695
Would give you information about the electrical activity of the heart in a transverse plane

119
00:06:56.255 --> 00:06:59.071
Let's imagine we take a cross-section through the ventricles

120
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:03.935
Sean over here is a bird's-eye view as if we were looking down on this cross-section

121
00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:09.055
The chest leads are unipolar so the only measure current going towards the particularly

122
00:07:09.823 --> 00:07:12.383
Lead V1 is directed towards the anterior of the heart

123
00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:15.455
Believe V6 is directed towards the left lateral Direction

124
00:07:16.223 --> 00:07:17.759
The other leads filling in between

125
00:07:19.807 --> 00:07:21.343
The electrons are duly placed

126
00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:22.879
In these following locations

127
00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:24.927
Lead V1

128
00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:28.767
Is place in 4th intercostal space just to the right of the sternum

129
00:07:29.535 --> 00:07:33.375
Weed V2 is also in the fourth intercostal space just to the left of the sternum

130
00:07:34.143 --> 00:07:39.775
Skip ahead to V4 and it's in the fifth intercostal space along the left midclavicular line

131
00:07:40.287 --> 00:07:43.103
Env3 Phil's Inn in between V2 and V4

132
00:07:44.127 --> 00:07:48.735
B5 goes in the fifth intercostal space along the left anterior axillary line

133
00:07:49.503 --> 00:07:53.855
Mv6 is also in the fifth intercostal space along the left mid axillary line

134
00:07:55.647 --> 00:07:59.743
Here's an example of the second half of a normal ECG which shows the precordial leads

135
00:08:00.511 --> 00:08:05.887
The First Column shows V1 V2 and V3 in the second column shows V4 V5 and V6

136
00:08:06.911 --> 00:08:08.447
Now it's put these two halves together

137
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:12.031
A standard 12-lead ECG has the following orientation

138
00:08:12.799 --> 00:08:15.615
The left-hand column shows leads 1 2 and 3

139
00:08:15.871 --> 00:08:18.943
The next column shows leads AVR AVL and avf

140
00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:24.319
The next column shows V1 V2 and V3 in the last column shows V4 V5 and V6

141
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:28.927
As usual at least one Rhythm strip below which is usually an extended lead to

142
00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:33.023
This particular ECG also has extended leads V1 and V5

143
00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:38.655
Now we can introduce some Concepts that are crucial for the clinical use of ECGs

144
00:08:39.167 --> 00:08:41.471
First let's talk about you to do territories

145
00:08:42.239 --> 00:08:46.335
The regions of the heart that are relevant to ECG interpretation are anteroseptal

146
00:08:46.591 --> 00:08:47.615
Intra apical

147
00:08:47.871 --> 00:08:50.431
Anterolateral lateral and inferior

148
00:08:50.943 --> 00:08:56.063
The posterior wall of the heart is a little complicated so we will leave it out until a later discussion

149
00:08:56.319 --> 00:08:57.087
Ischemia

150
00:08:58.367 --> 00:09:04.511
Here's the lead placement of V1 through V6 in the transverse plane which shows you how the leaves will correspond to different era

151
00:09:04.767 --> 00:09:05.279
Layers of the heart

152
00:09:06.047 --> 00:09:07.071
V1 to V2

153
00:09:07.327 --> 00:09:10.143
Give you information about the anteroseptal region of the heart

154
00:09:10.911 --> 00:09:14.239
V3 to V4 correspond to the entro apical region

155
00:09:14.751 --> 00:09:18.335
B-52 V6 correspond to the anterolateral aspect of the heart

156
00:09:18.591 --> 00:09:23.455
Now imagine the orientation of the limb leads 1 2 3 AVR AVL avf

157
00:09:23.711 --> 00:09:28.575
You can see how Li the one in AVL tell you information about the left lateral wall of the heart

158
00:09:29.343 --> 00:09:33.183
2 3 and avf correspond to the inferior aspect of the heart

159
00:09:33.951 --> 00:09:36.767
Weed aviars left out in terms of anatomical location

160
00:09:37.791 --> 00:09:41.119
Now let's dive into a discussion of the coronary arteries

161
00:09:41.375 --> 00:09:43.423
You may remember some of this from Anatomy

162
00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:47.007
Coronary arteries Supply blood to specific regions of the heart

163
00:09:47.775 --> 00:09:49.311
We should begin with the caveat

164
00:09:49.567 --> 00:09:52.639
But every person has variation in the coronary Anatomy

165
00:09:53.151 --> 00:09:56.735
But we will discuss the most common convention for describing the coronary arteries

166
00:09:58.015 --> 00:10:00.575
The left coronary artery and left Main

167
00:10:00.831 --> 00:10:05.183
Divides into the left anterior descending artery and the left circumflex coronary artery

168
00:10:05.695 --> 00:10:11.839
The LED runs along the interventricular septum and gives off septal branches that Supply blood to the septum

169
00:10:12.095 --> 00:10:15.167
And diagonal branches that Supply blood to the anterior wall

170
00:10:15.423 --> 00:10:16.959
Apex and sum of the lateral wall

171
00:10:17.983 --> 00:10:21.055
The circumflex wraps around the left wall of the heart

172
00:10:21.311 --> 00:10:24.639
And supplies the lateral and posterior walls of the left ventricle

173
00:10:25.663 --> 00:10:31.807
Since the left lateral wall is supplied by combination of diagonal branches of the LED as well as obtuse marginal

174
00:10:32.063 --> 00:10:33.855
Branches of the left circumflex

175
00:10:34.111 --> 00:10:38.975
You can imagine the variation exist in which one or the other artery dominates the supply

176
00:10:40.511 --> 00:10:44.351
The right coronary artery comes down like this and wraps underneath the heart

177
00:10:45.119 --> 00:10:49.471
IT Supplies SA node AV node right ventricle and inferior region of the heart

178
00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:51.263
Here's why this is important

179
00:10:51.775 --> 00:10:57.919
Because ECG leads correspond to specific regions of the heart and those regions are supplied by specific coronary arteries

180
00:10:58.175 --> 00:11:04.319
We can infer that a blockage in artery during a myocardial infarction will show up as a change in the ECG leads

181
00:11:04.575 --> 00:11:07.135
The correspond to the region supplied by that artery

182
00:11:07.647 --> 00:11:08.927
So just to review

183
00:11:09.439 --> 00:11:13.535
V1 and V2 give you information about the anteroseptal region of the heart

184
00:11:14.303 --> 00:11:16.095
Since the anteroseptal region

185
00:11:16.351 --> 00:11:22.495
It supplied by the septal branches off of the Proxima LED you can see that leads V1 and V2 give you a

186
00:11:22.751 --> 00:11:24.543
Information about the proximal LED

187
00:11:26.079 --> 00:11:28.895
V3 and V4 correspond to the anterior apical region

188
00:11:29.407 --> 00:11:31.455
Which is supplied by the mid distal LED

189
00:11:32.735 --> 00:11:38.879
V5 and V6 correspond to the anterolateral aspect of the heart which is other supplied by diagonal branches of the LED orb

190
00:11:39.135 --> 00:11:41.183
Obtuse marginal branches of the circumflex

191
00:11:42.463 --> 00:11:47.327
One AVL corresponds the left lateral wall of the heart which is supplied by the circumflex

192
00:11:47.583 --> 00:11:50.143
At least one AVL should tell you about the circumflex

193
00:11:50.655 --> 00:11:56.543
And finally with 2 3 and avf tell you about the inferior region of the heart which is supplied by the RCA

194
00:11:57.311 --> 00:12:00.895
You may have noticed that all chest leads provide information about the LED

195
00:12:01.407 --> 00:12:04.223
That should tell you that the LED isn't extremely important artery

196
00:12:04.479 --> 00:12:09.343
Of course the left ventricle is a Powerhouse that pumps blood throughout your entire systemic circulation

197
00:12:09.855 --> 00:12:13.183
So the artery that supplies the bulk of the left ventricle must be important

198
00:12:13.951 --> 00:12:17.535
In fact the LED is the most common coronary artery to become occluded

199
00:12:17.791 --> 00:12:19.839
And a blockage in approximately d

200
00:12:20.095 --> 00:12:22.655
Is colloquially known as a Widowmaker

201
00:12:22.911 --> 00:12:25.727
To the high mortality rates associated with this specific lesion
