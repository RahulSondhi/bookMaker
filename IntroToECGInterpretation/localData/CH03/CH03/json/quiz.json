Each small box corresponds to 0.04 seconds, so 3 small boxes corresponds to 0.12 seconds. Therefore, a QRS complex that spans 3 small boxes indicates that the ventricles took 0.12 seconds to depolarize.","",""],"correctAnswer":3,"startTime":142.043344,"wrongTime":142.043344,"startTimeSet":true,"wrongTimeSet":true},{"type":"mc","questionText":"Calculate the heart rate of this ECG.","answerText":["70-80 bpm","90-100 bpm","110-120 bpm","130-140 bpm","150-160 bpm"],"expoText":["","","","Explanation: The correct answer is 130-140 bpm. Therefore, this is your first ABNORMAL ECG. Since a normal heart rate is less than 100 bpm, a heart rate of 130-140 bpm is considered TACHYCARDIC. Using the 300 method, you can see that there are just over 2 large boxes between consecutive beats, which corresponds to just under 150 bpm - let\u2019s say around 135 bpm. Now, using the rhythm strip rule, I count 23 QRS complexes in the 10 second rhythm strip, which corresponds to 138 bpm.",""],"correctAnswer":4,"startTime":463.052153,"wrongTime":463.052153,"startTimeSet":true,"wrongTimeSet":true},{"type":"mc","questionText":"Determine the rhythm of this ECG.","answerText":["Atrial fibrillation","Normal sinus rhythm","Sinus bradycardia","Sinus tachycardia",""],"expoText":["","","Explanation: You can see P waves before every QRS complex. You can also see a QRS complex following every P wave. The P waves in leads I and II are upright. Therefore, this is sinus rhythm. Next, you had to determine the heart rate. Using the aforementioned methods, you probably could tell that the heart rate is about 55 bpm. Using the 300 method, there were just over 5 large boxes in between consecutive beats. Using the rhythm strip method, there are 9 beats per 10 seconds, yielding 54 bpm. Because the heart rate is less than 60 bpm, this is bradycardia. Therefore, the rhythm is sinus bradycardia.","",""],"correctAnswer":3,"startTime":620.776796,"wrongTime":620.776796,"startTimeSet":true,"wrongTimeSet":true},{"type":"mc","questionText":"Calculate the following intervals for this ECG.

I counted 11 boxes, which corresponds to 0.44 seconds - this is the QT interval. To correct for the heart rate, we need to calculate the QTc by dividing the QT by the square root of the R-R interval. I counted approximately 25 small boxes between consecutive R waves. Thus, the R-R interval is 0.04 seconds per small box times 25 small boxes, which yields exactly 1 second. The square root of 1 second is 1 second. So you are dividing the QT interval by 1. Therefore, the QTc is also 0.44 seconds. In this case, the QT interval and the QTc are the same.\n","",""],"correctAnswer":3,"startTime":792.105512,"wrongTime":792,"startTimeSet":true,"wrongTimeSet":true},{"type":"mc","questionText":"Which of the following can cause a prolonged QTc interval?","answerText":["Hypomagnesemia","Hypocalcemia","Hypokalemia","Anti-psychotic medications","All of the above"],"expoText":["","","","","Explanation: A prolonged QTc interval can lead to Torsades de Pointes, which is a potentially fatal form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (we will further discuss Torsades de Pointes in Module 5: Ventricular Arrhythmias).
