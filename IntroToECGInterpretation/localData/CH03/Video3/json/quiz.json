This is why AFib and WPW are so dangerous together. The atrial impulses can be transmitted through to the ventricles using the accessory pathway, without the AV node to stop them.\n\nB - The atrial impulses can transmit directly through the accessory tract to the ventricles, bypassing the AV node. This causes a shortening of the time between atrial contraction and ventricular contraction, which means a shortened PR interval.\n\nD - WPW and AFib can occur simultaneously, which can precipitate a life-threatening tachycardia\n","",""]},{"type":"mc","questionText":"Does this example meet the criteria for pSVT?","answerText":["Yes","No","","",""],"correctAnswer":"1","startTime":"502.889859","wrongTime":502.26221641328,"startTimeSet":true,"wrongTimeSet":true,"expoText":["Explanation:\nThe rate is tachycardic around 185 bpm (I count 31 beats in the 10 second strip). There are no identifiable P waves, and the QRS complexes are narrow. The rhythm is regular with 8 small boxes between QRS complexes. And there are ST depressions basically throughout. This example meets all of these criteria, so it represents pSVT. This may be due to AVNRT, but that cannot be determined from the ECG.\n","","","",""]}]}
