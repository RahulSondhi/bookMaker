1
00:00:01.024 --> 00:00:06.144
I think you have not reached the point where you can distinguish between a normal ECG and an abnormal ECG

2
00:00:06.912 --> 00:00:11.520
So now we can finally discuss how do identify specific causes of ECG abnormalities

3
00:00:11.776 --> 00:00:13.824
Starting with super ventricular arrhythmias

4
00:00:14.592 --> 00:00:17.920
The next few sections will have a lot of ECGs and clinical relevance

5
00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:23.808
Supra ventricular arrhythmias are abnormalities in the electrical conduction system

6
00:00:24.064 --> 00:00:25.344
That occur Above The ventricle

7
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.416
Meaning with an SA node Atria or AV node

8
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.512
Although the atrium may be going crazy and supraventricular arrhythmias

9
00:00:32.768 --> 00:00:38.400
The impulses are usually still funneled through the AV node and activate the normal rapid his purkinje system

10
00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:43.008
So the QRS complex in supraventricular arrhythmias

11
00:00:43.264 --> 00:00:44.544
Is usually not prolonged

12
00:00:45.056 --> 00:00:46.592
This is calling narrow complex

13
00:00:47.616 --> 00:00:48.384
In contrast

14
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.784
Ventricular arrhythmias usually bypass to normal his purkinje system and spread throughout the ventricles via slow my

15
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.320
Last Light to my site spread

16
00:00:57.088 --> 00:00:59.136
This causes a prolonged QRS

17
00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:00.160
Call they wide comp

18
00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.512
We will focus on sinus bradycardia sinus tachycardia

19
00:01:05.024 --> 00:01:07.072
Atrial fibrillation atrial flutter

20
00:01:07.328 --> 00:01:11.424
Wolff-parkinson-white syndrome and avrt and avnrt

21
00:01:13.984 --> 00:01:16.032
First let's talk about sinus bradycardia

22
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.336
Since it has the word sinus in it

23
00:01:18.592 --> 00:01:23.968
You know that the impulse originates within the SA node and should follow all the standard criteria of a sinus rhythm

24
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.784
Such as every P wave is followed by QRS

25
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.064
Ever QRS

26
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.344
Preceded by a p-wave

27
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.904
And the P wave is upright in leads 1 and 2

28
00:01:32.672 --> 00:01:37.536
But sinus bradycardia occurs when the SA node Fires at a rate less than 60 beats per minute

29
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.376
Sinus bradycardia is often asymptomatic but if severe

30
00:01:41.632 --> 00:01:44.704
Can cause a drop in cardiac output that causes lightheadedness or sink

31
00:01:46.752 --> 00:01:50.336
Many people have sinus bradycardia when they're sleeping which is normal

32
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.944
Athletes may have chronic sinus bradycardia due to increased vagal tone

33
00:01:55.968 --> 00:02:00.576
Aside from these benign reasons there are many causes of pathologic sinus bradycardia

34
00:02:01.856 --> 00:02:02.880
Medication effects

35
00:02:03.136 --> 00:02:06.464
Should be in early consideration when determining the cause of sinus bradycardia

36
00:02:07.232 --> 00:02:09.536
Possible culprits include beta blockers

37
00:02:09.792 --> 00:02:12.352
Non dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers

38
00:02:12.864 --> 00:02:14.656
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors

39
00:02:14.912 --> 00:02:15.680
Digitalis

40
00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:16.448
Sedatives

41
00:02:16.704 --> 00:02:17.216
An opioid

42
00:02:18.752 --> 00:02:20.800
Another causes sick sinus syndrome

43
00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:23.872
Which is where a dysfunctional SA node causes bradycardia

44
00:02:24.128 --> 00:02:25.920
And this is usually seen in older patients

45
00:02:27.456 --> 00:02:29.504
A stomach can cause sinus bradycardia

46
00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:34.880
The right coronary artery supplies blood to the SA node and AV node in the majority of patients

47
00:02:35.648 --> 00:02:37.696
If the RCA is occluded during a stemi

48
00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:43.072
There can be SA node and AV node ischemia which can lead to bradycardia or heart block respectively

49
00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:48.704
Sinus bradycardia and complete heart block during an MRI are usually transient

50
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.496
And resolved within 24 hours

51
00:02:52.032 --> 00:02:55.360
Increase vagal activity can be caused by valsalva maneuver

52
00:02:55.616 --> 00:02:57.152
Coughing or carotid massage

53
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.248
And any brain pathology that increases intracranial pressure

54
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.624
Can cause bradycardia is part of the Cushing reflex of hypertension bradycardia and bradypnea

55
00:03:07.648 --> 00:03:09.952
The bradycardia is due to increased vagal tone

56
00:03:11.744 --> 00:03:13.280
As a physiological correlate

57
00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:17.632
Vagal stimulation leads to increase acetylcholine released onto the SA node

58
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.216
This activates GI coupled muscarinic receptors

59
00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:23.264
Is causing a decrease in cyclic GMP

60
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.824
Which decreases the SA node the pacemaker

61
00:03:26.848 --> 00:03:30.432
Acetylcholine also activates acetylcholine gated potassium channels

62
00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:31.712
Annie Fox

63
00:03:31.968 --> 00:03:34.016
Potassium hyperpolarizes the SA node

64
00:03:34.528 --> 00:03:35.808
Also causing a decrease

65
00:03:36.064 --> 00:03:36.576
Pacemaker

66
00:03:38.112 --> 00:03:42.208
Other causes of sinus bradycardia include hypothyroidism hypothermia

67
00:03:42.464 --> 00:03:43.232
Hypoxia

68
00:03:43.744 --> 00:03:44.768
Anorexia nervosa

69
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.560
Obstructive sleep apnea

70
00:03:46.816 --> 00:03:47.840
Or certain infection

71
00:03:48.864 --> 00:03:53.472
The most important treatment in sinus bradycardia is to identify and correct the underlying cause

72
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.824
The gold standard medication for symptomatic sinus bradycardia is at

73
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.152
Japan giving us half a milligram IV push every 3 to 5 minutes

74
00:04:02.688 --> 00:04:04.736
Atropine is a muscarinic antagonist

75
00:04:04.992 --> 00:04:07.808
So it blocks the effect of acetylcholine on the SA node

76
00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:09.088
Which we just discussed

77
00:04:09.856 --> 00:04:11.136
This will increase the heart rate

78
00:04:11.392 --> 00:04:12.672
What should improve cardiac output

79
00:04:13.952 --> 00:04:19.071
Other medications used for sinus bradycardia include epinephrine dopamine or glucagon

80
00:04:19.583 --> 00:04:24.959
Refractory cases it may be necessary to Pace the heart using transcutaneous or transvenous pacemaker

81
00:04:25.471 --> 00:04:26.239
But always remember

82
00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:27.519
Patient must have

83
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:31.103
If a patient sleep and you notice that the monitor shows a heart rate of 50

84
00:04:31.359 --> 00:04:32.639
Please don't push atropine

85
00:04:33.663 --> 00:04:35.455
Now we should talk about sinus tachycardia

86
00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:37.759
Again this Rhythm originates

87
00:04:38.015 --> 00:04:38.783
An SA node

88
00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.599
So it must meet all the requirements of a sinus rhythm

89
00:04:42.367 --> 00:04:43.391
Sinus tachycardia is

90
00:04:43.647 --> 00:04:46.463
Is extremely common and can be a normal physiological response

91
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:51.327
When you go for a run you want your heart rate to elevate accordingly to increase oxygen delivery

92
00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:56.959
It often occurs due to an increase in sympathetic tone or a decrease in parasympathetic tone

93
00:04:58.239 --> 00:05:00.799
The most important causes include exercise

94
00:05:01.055 --> 00:05:02.335
Pain anxiety

95
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:03.103
Fever

96
00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:04.639
Hypovolemia

97
00:05:04.895 --> 00:05:08.991
Because when intravascular volume is depleted by a hemorrhage or dehydration

98
00:05:09.247 --> 00:05:11.807
Stroke volume Falls causing cardiac output to fall

99
00:05:12.575 --> 00:05:18.719
Since there isn't enough volume your heart can't really improve stroke volume so it increases heart rate to improve cardiac output causing

100
00:05:18.975 --> 00:05:19.743
Sinus tachycardia

101
00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:24.351
If low-risk for CHF give IV fluids in the tachycardia May resolve

102
00:05:25.631 --> 00:05:27.423
Other causes are hypotension

103
00:05:27.679 --> 00:05:28.447
Hypoxia

104
00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:29.727
Hypoglycemia

105
00:05:29.983 --> 00:05:31.007
Hyperthyroidism

106
00:05:31.519 --> 00:05:33.055
Anemia sepsis

107
00:05:33.567 --> 00:05:34.591
Pulmonary embolism

108
00:05:35.103 --> 00:05:35.615
Stimulants

109
00:05:35.871 --> 00:05:38.431
Such as nicotine caffeine and cocaine

110
00:05:38.943 --> 00:05:41.503
Alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal

111
00:05:42.015 --> 00:05:45.599
Medication such as amphetamines anticholinergic SAR others

112
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:48.671
Pain medication withdrawal specifically beta blocker

113
00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:55.071
Pathologic sinus tachycardia can cause palpitations but is often asymptomatic

114
00:05:55.583 --> 00:06:01.215
However significant tachycardia in a patient with pre-existing heart disease may cause a worsening of their condition

115
00:06:01.983 --> 00:06:03.775
Systole is a fixed entity

116
00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:07.615
So when your heart rate increases is because diastole has been cut short

117
00:06:08.383 --> 00:06:12.479
This means a decrease in both coronary artery filling time and ventricular filling

118
00:06:13.503 --> 00:06:17.343
The rapid rate also causes an increase in myocardial oxygen demand

119
00:06:17.855 --> 00:06:21.439
Does a patient with coronary artery atherosclerosis who becomes

120
00:06:21.695 --> 00:06:24.255
Tachycardic may experience angina or dyspnea

121
00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:27.583
Treatment should be targeted at the underlying etiology

122
00:06:28.351 --> 00:06:32.959
For example if a patient is writhing in pain from kidney stone and you noticed that he or she is tachycardic

123
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:34.751
Treating the pain with analgesic

124
00:06:35.263 --> 00:06:36.799
Should causes tachycardia to resolve

125
00:06:37.567 --> 00:06:43.711
Although giving a beta blocker would make the vital signs look better on the monitor frankly this would be bad medicine because it would do nothing to help the patient

126
00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.271
This would be treating the number rather than treating them

127
00:06:47.295 --> 00:06:53.183
If a tachycardia is a physiological response to something then it may be necessary to maintain adequate cardiac output

128
00:06:54.207 --> 00:06:54.719
Similarly

129
00:06:54.975 --> 00:07:01.119
If someone with a GI bug has persistent vomiting and diarrhea with tachycardia then give fluids for their suspected hypovolemia and the tiger

130
00:07:01.375 --> 00:07:02.143
Call you should resolve

131
00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:03.679
Most commonly

132
00:07:03.935 --> 00:07:06.751
Patient is nervous in the Ed and they have tachycardia

133
00:07:07.007 --> 00:07:09.311
Wait until they come down in the tachycardia May resolve

134
00:07:10.591 --> 00:07:14.431
Infants and young children can have normal heart rates up to 160 beats per minute

135
00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:18.015
It can be alarmed when you also take such a rapid rate but don't mistake

136
00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.039
Healthy Pediatric
