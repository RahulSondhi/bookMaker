00:00:01.792 --> 00:00:07.936
Next let's talk about wolff-parkinson-white syndrome or wpw which is also appropriately called ventricular

2
00:00:08.192 --> 00:00:09.216
Pre excitation syndrome

3
00:00:10.752 --> 00:00:16.640
This syndrome affects about 1 in 1.500 people and it is highly tested because of the unique ECG appearance

4
00:00:16.896 --> 00:00:18.944
And correlation with the underlying physiology

5
00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:22.016
These people have an accessory pathway

6
00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:22.784
AK

7
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.808
Bypass track

8
00:00:24.064 --> 00:00:25.344
Known as a bundle of Kent

9
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.112
The connect

10
00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:27.392
The Atria to the ventricles

11
00:00:28.672 --> 00:00:33.024
This allows atrial impulses to bypass the AV node and transmit right through the venture

12
00:00:35.072 --> 00:00:41.216
Because the bundle of Kent last the gatekeeper function of the AV node the atrial impulse is conducted very rapidly to the venture

13
00:00:41.984 --> 00:00:43.776
Which causes shortening of the PR interval

14
00:00:45.056 --> 00:00:47.616
However the accessory pathway does not connect

15
00:00:47.872 --> 00:00:49.152
To the rapid his purkinje system

16
00:00:50.176 --> 00:00:54.272
Instead the impulse spreads throughout the ventricles via the slow ventricular myocardium

17
00:00:55.296 --> 00:00:57.344
So that would look like this on ECG right

18
00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:03.232
Concurrently the atrial impulses are transmitted normally through the AV node to the rapid

19
00:01:03.488 --> 00:01:04.000
Pittsburgh

20
00:01:04.512 --> 00:01:05.280
And that looks like that

21
00:01:06.304 --> 00:01:11.168
Does the QRS pattern will be a combination of the early activation via the accessory pathway

22
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.240
As well as the normal activation we are the normal pathway

23
00:01:15.264 --> 00:01:16.544
When you combine these together

24
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.384
You see a slurred upstroke that looks like a notch at the beginning of the QRS

25
00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:22.176
This is called the Delta wave

26
00:01:22.432 --> 00:01:24.480
And this Delta wave widens the QRS

27
00:01:25.248 --> 00:01:30.112
So the features of wpw or short PR interval do the early activation of the ventricles

28
00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:31.904
The accessory pathway

29
00:01:32.672 --> 00:01:34.464
A Delta wave at the beginning of the QRS

30
00:01:35.488 --> 00:01:36.768
And a prolonged QRS

31
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.424
Because the QRS is really the slow accessory ventricular activation superimposed on top of the normal ventricular app

32
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.192
Activation

33
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.800
The delta-wave is the obvious giveaway for quickly recognizing wpw

34
00:01:50.336 --> 00:01:51.104
This example

35
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.944
Shows a PR interval under three small boxes or 120 milliseconds

36
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.712
So what is short

37
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.808
It has a Delta Notch that is most obvious here in lead AVL

38
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.904
And has a prolonged QRS greater than 3.5 small boxes

39
00:02:05.696 --> 00:02:09.792
Now imagine that a patient has accessory pathway in addition to a favor a flutter

40
00:02:10.304 --> 00:02:13.376
The constant barrage of atrial impulses have another route

41
00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:15.424
To the ventricles using the accessory pathway

42
00:02:15.936 --> 00:02:18.496
I can bypass the AV nodes gatekeeper function

43
00:02:18.752 --> 00:02:20.032
Causing severe tachycardia

44
00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:26.432
A-fib plus wpw can cause ventricular rates that reach 300 beats per minute which can be fatal

45
00:02:27.968 --> 00:02:29.248
There's also a scenario

46
00:02:29.504 --> 00:02:33.344
Where the impulse can travel anterograde down the AV node and then splits

47
00:02:33.856 --> 00:02:36.416
Impulse continues anterograde to activate the ventricle

48
00:02:36.672 --> 00:02:38.208
Spinner also travels retrograde

49
00:02:38.464 --> 00:02:41.280
Through the accessory tract and reactivate the AV node

50
00:02:42.304 --> 00:02:43.840
The opposite is also possible

51
00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:47.168
Where the impulse travels anterograde down accessory track

52
00:02:47.424 --> 00:02:48.704
And then activates the ventricles

53
00:02:49.216 --> 00:02:53.056
And travels retrograde through the AV node to reactivate the accessory path

54
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.872
This is known as a reentrant loop

55
00:02:56.128 --> 00:02:58.176
I can cause constant activation of The ventricle

56
00:02:58.688 --> 00:03:00.736
Which precipitates a severe tachycardia

57
00:03:01.504 --> 00:03:04.832
This is called atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia

58
00:03:05.088 --> 00:03:06.368
Or avrt

59
00:03:06.624 --> 00:03:08.928
Enter the type of paroxysmal SVT

60
00:03:10.208 --> 00:03:12.512
Symptoms include palpitations and syncope

61
00:03:12.768 --> 00:03:14.816
But it can also cause sudden cardiac death

62
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.472
When the patient is in sinus rhythm wpw will have a unique ECG appearance

63
00:03:21.728 --> 00:03:23.008
Due to the accessory pathway

64
00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.056
But is usually asymptomatic

65
00:03:25.824 --> 00:03:30.944
This is called a wpw pattern and it predisposes the patient to the dangerous arrhythmia

66
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.016
But this is not referred to as wpw syndrome

67
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.136
When the accessory pathway forms re-entrant Loop that causes a VRT

68
00:03:39.392 --> 00:03:41.696
This is referred to as wpw syndrome

69
00:03:43.232 --> 00:03:48.096
Treatment of wpw syndrome is tricky because the normal beta blockers and calcium channel blockers

70
00:03:48.352 --> 00:03:50.656
Contraindicated in certain types of wpw

71
00:03:51.168 --> 00:03:56.288
Specifically when a fib and a flutter or causing ventricular pre-excitation through the accessory pathway

72
00:03:57.568 --> 00:04:02.176
Beta blockers and calcium channel blockers are effective at slowing down conduction through the AV node

73
00:04:02.432 --> 00:04:05.248
But they may actually speed up conduction through an accessory track

74
00:04:05.504 --> 00:04:06.784
And what does contraindicated

75
00:04:07.808 --> 00:04:08.576
Ibutilide

76
00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:10.112
Class 3 antiarrhythmic

77
00:04:10.368 --> 00:04:11.136
Is effective

78
00:04:11.392 --> 00:04:15.488
I prolong the refractory period of both the AV node and the accessory pathway

79
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.536
And can often terminate the arrhythmia

80
00:04:18.303 --> 00:04:22.143
Importantly if a tachycardia is ever causing he would anomic instability

81
00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:24.703
Electrical cardioversion is needed emergently

82
00:04:25.727 --> 00:04:30.079
Catheter ablation of the accessory pathway is Curative but would never be attempting in an emergency

83
00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:35.967
Lastly let's talk about AV nodal reentrant tachycardia

84
00:04:36.223 --> 00:04:37.503
Or avnrt

85
00:04:38.015 --> 00:04:40.063
Mostly because the physiology is really cool

86
00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:42.623
Avnrt

87
00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:43.903
Like a VRT

88
00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:46.207
Is a type of paroxysmal SVT

89
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:51.071
It is somewhat unique because it usually occurs in young adults with otherwise Normal Heart

90
00:04:52.607 --> 00:04:53.631
What's in the AV node

91
00:04:53.887 --> 00:04:56.703
Some people have two Pathways with different electrical features

92
00:04:57.471 --> 00:05:00.287
The fast pathway has a fast conduction velocity

93
00:05:00.543 --> 00:05:01.823
The long refractory period

94
00:05:02.335 --> 00:05:06.431
While the slow pathway has a slow conduction velocity but a shorter refractory period

95
00:05:07.711 --> 00:05:10.271
Normally an atrial impulse activates them both

96
00:05:10.527 --> 00:05:13.087
But the fast pathway reaches the bundle of his first

97
00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:15.391
Activating ventricular depolarization

98
00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:17.951
By the time the slow pathway gets there

99
00:05:18.207 --> 00:05:20.255
The bundle of hiss is in its refractory period

100
00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:22.559
And the slow pathway signal is extinguished

101
00:05:23.071 --> 00:05:26.655
So the fast pathway is the only functional pathway under normal conditions

102
00:05:28.191 --> 00:05:32.031
However if there was a random perfectly-timed atrial premature beat

103
00:05:32.287 --> 00:05:35.871
It may reach the AV node while the fast pathway is still refractory

104
00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.943
The slow pathway has a shorter refractory period

105
00:05:39.455 --> 00:05:42.527
So the impulse can travel down the slow Pathway to reach the bundle of hiss

106
00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:44.831
Which propagates the impulse to the ventricles

107
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:49.951
When the impulse reaches the bundle of hiss the fast pathway is no longer a fracture

108
00:05:50.463 --> 00:05:53.279
So in addition to traveling anterograde to the ventricles

109
00:05:53.535 --> 00:05:57.119
The impulse actually travels backward or retrograde through the fast pathway

110
00:05:58.143 --> 00:06:00.703
It activates the Atria of the arrest regret conduction

111
00:06:01.215 --> 00:06:04.031
Causing the Atria to contract while the ventricles are Contracting

112
00:06:05.055 --> 00:06:07.103
But it also reactivates the slope app

113
00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:10.687
So the slow pathway activates the ventricles and the fast pathway

114
00:06:10.943 --> 00:06:14.015
And then the fast pathway activates the Atria and the slow pathway

115
00:06:14.783 --> 00:06:16.319
This causes re-entrant Loop

116
00:06:16.575 --> 00:06:19.647
An atria and ventricles are constantly stimulated at the same time

117
00:06:20.927 --> 00:06:26.559
So avrt is when a reactant Lube is created between the AV node and then accessory tract

118
00:06:26.815 --> 00:06:28.351
The connects the Atria to the ventricles

119
00:06:28.607 --> 00:06:30.143
Such as in wpw syndrome

120
00:06:30.911 --> 00:06:36.799
Avnrt is when a reentrant loop is created between the fast and slow Pathways within the AV node

121
00:06:37.567 --> 00:06:39.359
They have the same clinical presentation

122
00:06:39.615 --> 00:06:41.919
And you cannot distinguish between the two on ECG

123
00:06:42.175 --> 00:06:45.247
So both fall under the label of paroxysmal SVT

124
00:06:46.015 --> 00:06:48.575
To tell avrt from avnrt

125
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:52.159
You need to map the cardiac conduction system Vienna EP study

126
00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:55.999
So what does paroxysmal SVT look like on an ECG

127
00:06:57.023 --> 00:07:01.375
Does tachycardia usually between 140 and 250 beats per minute

128
00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:06.239
Is also absent P wave because the retrograde activation of the Atria

129
00:07:06.495 --> 00:07:09.823
Occurs at the same time as anterograde activation of the ventricles

130
00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:12.383
So the p waves are hidden in the QRS complex

131
00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:17.247
If p waves are present they will occur slightly after the QRS complex

132
00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:24.159
They will be inverted in the inferior leads 2 3 and avf because the APR being depolarized in retrograde fashion

133
00:07:24.415 --> 00:07:27.743
Meaning the impulse spreads superiorly away from those leads

134
00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:32.095
Through also be a narrow or normal QRS interval

135
00:07:32.863 --> 00:07:36.959
Is absolutely crucial to note that an avnrt and usually avrt

136
00:07:37.215 --> 00:07:41.055
The ventricles are being activated by the normal intrinsic his purkinje system

137
00:07:41.567 --> 00:07:43.615
7th regular contractions should be crisp

138
00:07:44.383 --> 00:07:45.407
The QRS interval

139
00:07:45.663 --> 00:07:47.967
Should be normal or under 120 milliseconds

140
00:07:48.223 --> 00:07:50.271
Men getting narrow complex tachycardia

141
00:07:51.295 --> 00:07:54.879
This is important because absent p waves and wide QRS complexes

142
00:07:55.135 --> 00:07:59.487
What indicates ventricular tachycardia which is a potentially fatal condition that would be handled differently

143
00:08:00.511 --> 00:08:05.887
In addition note that the QRS complexes occur at regular intervals in avnrt

144
00:08:06.143 --> 00:08:09.727
Which helps differentiate it from the irregularly irregular pattern of aphid

145
00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:15.103
And lastly st-segment depressions and T wave inversions are often present

146
00:08:15.871 --> 00:08:22.015
They're caused by repolarization abnormalities and usually do not indicate ischemia unless there's underlying coronary artery disease

147
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:27.903
Avnrt is known as a paroxysmal SVT

148
00:08:28.415 --> 00:08:33.023
And the word paroxysmal means sudden onset of severe symptoms with sudden termination

149
00:08:33.791 --> 00:08:36.863
So these attacks usually are spontaneous and seem to come out of nowhere

150
00:08:37.119 --> 00:08:41.727
Although attacks can sometimes be linked to nicotine alcohol stimulants or exercise

151
00:08:42.751 --> 00:08:46.335
In otherwise healthy patients the symptoms are usually limited to palpitations

152
00:08:47.103 --> 00:08:50.431
Sometimes patients may experience light-headedness or shortness of breath

153
00:08:50.687 --> 00:08:54.271
And patients with underlying cardiac problems may experience syncope your engine

154
00:08:56.063 --> 00:08:59.391
Treatments are and a decrease in the conduction velocity of the AV node

155
00:08:59.647 --> 00:09:01.439
We can terminate the avnrt

156
00:09:02.463 --> 00:09:06.559
You can start with vagal Maneuvers with valsalva being more effective than carotid massage

157
00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:10.655
You could give IV adenosine starting with 6 mg

158
00:09:11.679 --> 00:09:15.775
You can also give IV calcium channel blockers beta blockers or digoxin

159
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:20.895
Severe hemodynamic compromise requires emergent electrical cardioversion

160
00:09:21.407 --> 00:09:23.711
Although this is really necessary with AV on RT

161
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:27.807
Catheter ablation of the slow pathway of the AV node

162
00:09:28.063 --> 00:09:28.831
Can be cured

163
00:09:29.343 --> 00:09:32.927
However you risk causing AV block if you also damage the fast pathway

164
00:09:34.207 --> 00:09:40.351
And as prevention for recurrent attacks you can give oral calcium channel blockers beta blockers digoxin or anti

165
00:09:40.607 --> 00:09:42.143
Eurythmics but those have severe side effects
