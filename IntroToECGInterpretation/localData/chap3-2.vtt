1
00:00:00.768 --> 00:00:03.328
Now imagine you are interpreting the rhythm of an ECG

2
00:00:03.584 --> 00:00:05.376
We are struggling to identify discrete p-wave

3
00:00:06.144 --> 00:00:09.472
Perhaps you can't make out any p-waves and perhaps the RR interval

4
00:00:09.728 --> 00:00:10.240
Is it regular

5
00:00:11.008 --> 00:00:15.616
If you're thinking the certainly doesn't look like normal sinus rhythm then you may be looking at atrial fibrillation

6
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.200
Afib is caused by abnormal chaotic impulse

7
00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:22.272
Caused by multiple wandering reentrant circuit

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.064
Often originating where the

9
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.112
The pulmonary veins enter the left atrium

10
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.416
It is seen more often patient

11
00:00:28.672 --> 00:00:30.464
The right or left atrial enlargement

12
00:00:31.744 --> 00:00:34.560
These abnormal impulses can cause the atrial rate

13
00:00:34.816 --> 00:00:37.632
Tourist 350 to 600 beats per minute

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.448
The atrial impulses are so rapid and disorganized

15
00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:42.752
That there are no identifiable p waves

16
00:00:43.776 --> 00:00:47.616
Here's where the life-saving gatekeeper function of the AV node comes into play

17
00:00:48.384 --> 00:00:50.944
If all the atrial impulses at a rate of 600

18
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.736
Or transmitted through the ventricle

19
00:00:52.992 --> 00:00:55.296
Then the ventricles would contract so frequently

20
00:00:55.552 --> 00:00:56.832
But they would not have time to fill

21
00:00:58.112 --> 00:01:02.208
Stroke volume would plummet causing a drop in cardiac output in cardiogenic shock

22
00:01:02.976 --> 00:01:07.328
Luckily the AV node has a refractory period And it blocks many of the atrial impulse

23
00:01:07.584 --> 00:01:08.352
Buses from reaching the bench

24
00:01:09.632 --> 00:01:10.912
Despite the AV nodes

25
00:01:11.168 --> 00:01:12.960
Life-saving gatekeeper function

26
00:01:13.216 --> 00:01:15.520
The ventricular rate can still be dangerously High

27
00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:20.896
And this arrhythmia is referred to as A-fib with rvr which stands for Rapid ventricular response

28
00:01:22.688 --> 00:01:26.528
The AV node left atrial impulses through in a seemingly random pattern

29
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.576
Which causes the QRS complex

30
00:01:28.832 --> 00:01:30.112
Sis to be irregularly spaced

31
00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:34.720
The distance between QRS complex is called the RR interval

32
00:01:34.976 --> 00:01:36.000
Varies from B2B

33
00:01:36.512 --> 00:01:39.328
This is why afib is called irregularly irregular

34
00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:43.424
The Irregular appearance can be more helpful for recognizing AFib

35
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.704
The abnormal p waves

36
00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.312
This is a great example of the irregularly irregular rhythm

37
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.896
Look at how Randomness pasties QRS complexes are

38
00:01:53.408 --> 00:01:56.992
A long pause here and then a cluster of fast beats and then another long pause

39
00:01:58.016 --> 00:01:59.040
Disregard you towards 8

40
00:01:59.552 --> 00:02:01.856
And the lack of identifiable p waves confirms it

41
00:02:02.624 --> 00:02:04.672
I count 19 QRS complexes

42
00:02:04.928 --> 00:02:06.208
In the 10-second Rhythm strip

43
00:02:06.464 --> 00:02:08.768
Which corresponds to 114 beats per minute

44
00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:10.304
So this is afib with rvr

45
00:02:11.584 --> 00:02:13.888
Afib with rvr may be asymptomatic

46
00:02:14.144 --> 00:02:16.448
But it can cause symptoms such as palpitations

47
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.728
Lightheadedness

48
00:02:17.984 --> 00:02:18.496
Dyspnea

49
00:02:18.752 --> 00:02:20.032
Chest pain and fatigue

50
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.176
Also when the Atria aren't contraction normally then you risk blood stasis within the Atria

51
00:02:26.432 --> 00:02:27.968
Especially the left atrial appendage

52
00:02:28.992 --> 00:02:34.624
As you know blood stasis is one of the components of virchow's Triad there's a risk factor for thrombus for me

53
00:02:35.648 --> 00:02:37.440
So patients with persistent AFib

54
00:02:37.696 --> 00:02:39.744
Are at risk of formula clotting Atria

55
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.536
Which can dislodge an emboli

56
00:02:42.304 --> 00:02:43.840
This is a common cause of stroke

57
00:02:45.888 --> 00:02:48.704
So the treatment of afib should include three considerations

58
00:02:49.216 --> 00:02:49.984
Rhythm control

59
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.008
Ray control

60
00:02:51.264 --> 00:02:52.288
And clot prevention

61
00:02:53.568 --> 00:02:55.360
Rhythm control means cardioversion

62
00:02:55.616 --> 00:02:56.896
To restore sinus rhythm

63
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.552
Cardioversion can either be performed chemically with class 1 A1C or 3 anti-arrhythmic drugs

64
00:03:04.064 --> 00:03:05.856
Or electrically using the paddles

65
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.208
Is crucial to assess for thrombus in the Atria before cardioversion

66
00:03:10.976 --> 00:03:15.584
If the patient converts back to sinus rhythm and their Atria start Contracting in a coordinated manner

67
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.912
They may squeeze the clot out of the Atria and precipitate a stroke

68
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.544
Therefore prior to cardioversion you should perform a transesophageal echocardiogram

69
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.568
RTE

70
00:03:25.824 --> 00:03:26.848
To look for a clock

71
00:03:27.616 --> 00:03:29.152
If there is no clotting Atria

72
00:03:29.408 --> 00:03:30.432
The new safety card over

73
00:03:31.456 --> 00:03:34.784
If there is a clot then the patient may need blood thinners to resolve the clock

74
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.880
And then a repeat te to ensure that the cloud is gone before you attempt

75
00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:39.648
Sicario

76
00:03:40.928 --> 00:03:44.256
If a patient is hemodynamically unstable dude AFib

77
00:03:44.512 --> 00:03:47.328
Electrical cardioversion may be emergently needed

78
00:03:48.608 --> 00:03:53.472
Rate control means slowing down the ventricular rate to improve ventricular filling time and cardiac output

79
00:03:54.752 --> 00:04:00.896
Beta blockers and non dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are great at increasing refractory period of the AV node

80
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.552
This decreases the number of atrial impulses that are conducted through the ventricles which decreases the ventricular rate

81
00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:11.648
Atrial impulses will continue to be chaotic and disorganized

82
00:04:11.904 --> 00:04:14.720
But as long as the ventricles are strong and rate controlled

83
00:04:15.232 --> 00:04:16.512
The cardiac output should be normal

84
00:04:18.303 --> 00:04:20.607
Chronic afib often requires anticoagulant

85
00:04:20.863 --> 00:04:24.703
Such as warfarin dabigatran rivaroxaban or apixaban

86
00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:25.983
Prevent thromboembolism

87
00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:28.799
However blood thinners can be quite dangerous

88
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:33.663
The patient hits their head while on blood thinners they might have a fatal intracranial bleed from a minor trauma

89
00:04:34.431 --> 00:04:36.991
Does the risks and benefits must always be considered

90
00:04:37.503 --> 00:04:41.855
An elderly patient with frequent Falls may be better off without blood thinners despite the stroke risk

91
00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:44.159
The Chad's vasc score

92
00:04:44.415 --> 00:04:46.463
Is used to assess a patient's risk factors

93
00:04:46.975 --> 00:04:49.791
For thromboembolism to determine the need for anticoagulation

94
00:04:51.327 --> 00:04:55.423
The medication digoxin is an inotrope that increases cardiac contractility

95
00:04:55.935 --> 00:04:57.215
It has dangerous side effects

96
00:04:57.471 --> 00:04:59.007
And can build up to toxic levels

97
00:04:59.263 --> 00:05:00.799
So it's uses falling out of fashion

98
00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:05.919
However digoxin also works to increase the refractory period of the AV node

99
00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:08.223
So it is useful for ventricular rate control

100
00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:11.807
So patients who have both CHF and AFib

101
00:05:12.063 --> 00:05:13.087
May benefit from both the

102
00:05:13.343 --> 00:05:14.367
Drake control properties

103
00:05:14.623 --> 00:05:15.903
And it's on atrophic effects

104
00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:21.023
Lastly certain patients benefit from percutaneous catheter ablation

105
00:05:21.535 --> 00:05:23.583
Which is intended to be a permanent cure

106
00:05:24.607 --> 00:05:28.959
Cardiac mapping is used to locate the area from which the abnormal impulses originating

107
00:05:29.727 --> 00:05:33.055
A catheter is inserted into a blood vessel and threaded Into the Heart

108
00:05:33.311 --> 00:05:37.919
Radiofrequency or Crowell thermal energy are used to destroy the problem area

109
00:05:38.431 --> 00:05:41.503
Because if it was caused by wondering reaction circuits

110
00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.807
Ablation for afib is not always effective

111
00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:47.391
Initial success rates were reportedly around 70%

112
00:05:48.415 --> 00:05:54.559
You might think it makes the most sense to cardiovert all of your patience and give him a shot at maintaining sinus rhythm and maybe even eventually

113
00:05:54.815 --> 00:05:55.839
Get them off blood thinners

114
00:05:56.863 --> 00:06:00.447
However even if cardioversion successfully restore sinus rhythm

115
00:06:00.703 --> 00:06:01.983
This is not a permanent solution

116
00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:04.031
As many patients revert back to 8

117
00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:07.871
They may require chronic antiarrhythmics to stay in sinus rhythm

118
00:06:08.127 --> 00:06:10.943
These medications have serious and potentially lethal side effects

119
00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:12.735
The Chronic you should be avoided

120
00:06:13.247 --> 00:06:15.807
You may be wondering which of the treatment options is best

121
00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:21.951
The affirm trial study this and show that there was no survival benefit for rhythm control over rate control

122
00:06:22.207 --> 00:06:25.279
And that Rhythm control is associated with more complications

123
00:06:26.047 --> 00:06:29.887
So rate control and anticoagulation are the Mainstays of treatment

124
00:06:30.143 --> 00:06:31.679
With ablation as a Curative option

125
00:06:32.447 --> 00:06:34.239
Atrial fibrillation is often contraste

126
00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:37.311
With atrial flutter and some patients switch from one to the other

127
00:06:39.103 --> 00:06:42.431
Those are abnormal atrial impulses that can cause tachycardia

128
00:06:42.687 --> 00:06:44.479
Depending on the AV node gatekeeper ability

129
00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:49.343
A flutter is caused by an anatomically fixed re-entrant circuit

130
00:06:49.855 --> 00:06:52.927
Often along the tricuspid valve annulus of the right atrium

131
00:06:53.951 --> 00:06:59.071
Well the p waves are not discernible an A-fib a flutter shows characteristic Sawtooth P wave

132
00:07:00.095 --> 00:07:01.119
In a flutter

133
00:07:01.375 --> 00:07:05.215
The atrial rate is usually 180 to 350 beats per minute

134
00:07:05.471 --> 00:07:07.007
Just not quite as rapid AFib

135
00:07:07.775 --> 00:07:12.127
Also atrial flutter is more regular and the conduction from the Atria to ventricles

136
00:07:12.383 --> 00:07:13.407
Is a fixed proportion

137
00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:18.271
For example a flutter may show an atrial rate of 300 and a ventricular rate of 150

138
00:07:18.783 --> 00:07:21.087
This is called a flutter with 2 to 1 conduction

139
00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:24.671
Which means that every other atrial impulse is transmitted through the bench

140
00:07:26.207 --> 00:07:28.767
For some reason a flutter tends to occur with the rates

141
00:07:29.023 --> 00:07:30.047
Factors of 300

142
00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:36.447
So if you see an atrial arrhythmia with an atrial rate of 150 and the reticular rate of 75 you should be suspicious for a flutter

143
00:07:37.983 --> 00:07:41.567
This ECG shows the obvious Sawtooth p waves of a flutter

144
00:07:43.103 --> 00:07:47.455
Similar to AFib patients can be asymptomatic if the ventricular rate is within normal limits

145
00:07:48.223 --> 00:07:51.039
Rapid a flutter can cause palpitations or dyspnea

146
00:07:51.807 --> 00:07:53.599
A flutter can also predispose page

147
00:07:53.855 --> 00:07:55.391
Directions to thromboemboli

148
00:07:56.671 --> 00:08:01.023
Treatments include electrical cardioversion or catheter ablation which is considered Curative

149
00:08:02.047 --> 00:08:02.815
Medical treatment

150
00:08:03.071 --> 00:08:05.887
Includes rate control with beta blockers or calcium channel blocker

151
00:08:07.167 --> 00:08:12.543
Anticoagulation for a flutter still being investigated but you're probably be treated similarly to AFib

152
00:08:13.055 --> 00:08:14.847
Catheter ablation is very effective

153
00:08:15.359 --> 00:08:17.407
It disrupting the anatomically fixed reentry

154
00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:18.687
Circuit of a flutter

155
00:08:19.455 --> 00:08:20.735
Ablation is much more effective

156
00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:22.271
For a flutter than for AFib

157
00:08:22.783 --> 00:08:25.343
What success rate sighted around 97%
