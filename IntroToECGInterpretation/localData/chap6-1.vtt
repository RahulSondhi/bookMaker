1
00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.888
Finally gets the most fun part of Cardiology ischemia and acute coronary syndrome

2
00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:09.216
Imagine you're in the Ed when a new patient is rolled in

3
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.056
Bob is a 67 year old male with a history of diabetes

4
00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:14.080
Hypertension

5
00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:19.968
Hyperlipidemia and coronary artery disease who presents to the severe chest pain that started 30 minutes ago

6
00:00:20.992 --> 00:00:23.296
Bob tells you that he has a history of chronic chest pain

7
00:00:23.808 --> 00:00:26.112
It occurs every time you walked more than a hundred yards

8
00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:28.672
Resolve completely with rest and nitroglycerin

9
00:00:29.952 --> 00:00:32.256
Bob's describing history of stable angina

10
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.840
Angina is chest pain due to cardiac ischemia

11
00:00:36.352 --> 00:00:39.168
Which is caused by an imbalance between the oxygen supply

12
00:00:39.424 --> 00:00:41.216
+ oxygen demand of the heart

13
00:00:42.496 --> 00:00:44.288
Myocardial oxygen supply

14
00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.336
Depends on the hemoglobin concentration

15
00:00:46.592 --> 00:00:48.640
An oxygen saturation which determine

16
00:00:48.896 --> 00:00:50.432
The oxygen content of the blood

17
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.784
Oxygen supply also depends on diastolic perfusion pressure

18
00:00:55.296 --> 00:01:00.160
Since the coronary arteries are filled by the backflow of blood from the aorta during diastole

19
00:01:01.184 --> 00:01:05.024
And lastly oxygen supply depends on coronary vascular resistance

20
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.912
Which is determined by local regulation by the end of helium and extrinsic regulation by the sympathetic nervous system

21
00:01:11.168 --> 00:01:15.264
Myocardial oxygen demand is determined by heart rate and contractility

22
00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:18.592
You would expect a heart that is beating harder and faster

23
00:01:18.848 --> 00:01:20.384
Have a higher metabolic demand

24
00:01:21.152 --> 00:01:25.248
In addition oxygen demand is determined by the wall tension of the ventricles

25
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.624
When the oxygen supply cannot meet the oxygen demand ischemia occur

26
00:01:31.392 --> 00:01:35.744
The subendocardium is The myocardium that is closest to the ventricular lumen

27
00:01:36.512 --> 00:01:39.840
The subendocardium is particularly susceptible to ischemia

28
00:01:40.096 --> 00:01:43.168
Because it is subjected to the highest pressure from The ventricle

29
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.472
It has fewer collateral connections

30
00:01:45.984 --> 00:01:50.080
I'm supplying arteries must first pass through layers of Contracting myocardium

31
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.640
Atheroscleratic plaques

32
00:01:52.896 --> 00:01:54.944
Cause stenosis of the coronary arteries

33
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.480
Which limits blood supply

34
00:01:57.504 --> 00:02:02.112
When a coronary artery is greater than 70% included due to an atherosclerotics flag

35
00:02:02.624 --> 00:02:04.416
The patient may be fun while it rest

36
00:02:04.928 --> 00:02:07.232
But with any physical or emotional stress

37
00:02:07.488 --> 00:02:11.840
The sympathetic nervous system increases heart rate contractility and blood pressure

38
00:02:12.096 --> 00:02:14.144
All of which increase oxygen demand

39
00:02:14.912 --> 00:02:18.496
So with exertion the demand increases but the supply cannot

40
00:02:18.752 --> 00:02:20.800
And sub in a cardiovascular and Sue's

41
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.200
This is why chest pain experienced while walking up a flight of stairs or shoveling snow is very concerning for

42
00:02:27.456 --> 00:02:28.224
For cardiac etiology

43
00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:31.552
This exertional sub endocardial ischemia

44
00:02:31.808 --> 00:02:32.832
A stable angina

45
00:02:33.088 --> 00:02:34.368
Is transient and reversible

46
00:02:35.136 --> 00:02:37.440
With rest the auction demand decreases

47
00:02:37.696 --> 00:02:38.720
And ischemia resolved

48
00:02:40.512 --> 00:02:43.072
The physiologic consequences of ischemia

49
00:02:43.328 --> 00:02:45.632
Are due to the decrease in available ATP

50
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.240
Systolic contraction is inhibited but so is diastolic relaxation

51
00:02:50.496 --> 00:02:52.544
Which is also an energy dependent process

52
00:02:53.312 --> 00:02:56.896
In addition ION channel dysfunction can precipitate arrhythmias

53
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.736
Ischemia is reversible but prolonged ischemia

54
00:03:00.992 --> 00:03:03.552
Can lead to irreversible infarction of cardiac muscle

55
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.672
Clinically ischemia is experience as angina pectoris

56
00:03:09.696 --> 00:03:15.840
This visceral pain is usually poorly localized but is often retrosternal with radiation to the arm back neck

57
00:03:16.096 --> 00:03:16.608
Rajah

58
00:03:17.632 --> 00:03:20.448
It is usually described as pressure tightness or heaviness

59
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.008
Is not described as sharp or flirting

60
00:03:24.032 --> 00:03:27.104
If your patient says it feels like there's an elephant sitting on my chest

61
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:29.408
Stampy concerned for cardiac ischemia

62
00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:31.712
The discomfort show last minutes

63
00:03:31.968 --> 00:03:35.296
Split-second Twins or chest discomfort is not cardiac ischemia

64
00:03:36.832 --> 00:03:40.416
In addition to the pain there's several commonly associated symptoms

65
00:03:40.928 --> 00:03:42.976
There is an autonomic surge due to the pain

66
00:03:43.488 --> 00:03:47.072
So sympathetic activation causes tachycardia and diaphoresis

67
00:03:47.584 --> 00:03:52.192
As well as peripheral vasoconstriction that least a cool clammy pale extremities

68
00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:56.032
Parasympathetic activation causes nausea and vomiting

69
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.104
Due to impaired diastolic relaxation

70
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.664
The ventricular end-diastolic pressure increase

71
00:04:02.432 --> 00:04:05.504
This pressure is transmitted back to the pulmonary vasculature

72
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.064
Causing dyspnea and Pulmonary vascular congestion

73
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.928
Also is systemic inflammatory response causes a low-grade fever

74
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.512
What does ischemia look like on an ECG

75
00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:22.655
Sub endocardial ischemia appears as horizontal or downsloping ST depression

76
00:04:23.679 --> 00:04:28.287
This means the segment between the QRS complex and the T wave will be below the bassline

77
00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:32.639
Sub endocardial ischemia also results in T wave inversion

78
00:04:34.431 --> 00:04:40.063
If the ischemia is severe it may affect the entire thickness of The myocardium known as transmural ischemia

79
00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:42.111
Rather than just a subendocardium

80
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:45.951
Transmural ischemia appears as st-elevation

81
00:04:46.207 --> 00:04:49.023
Meaning of c segment will be raised above Baseline

82
00:04:50.303 --> 00:04:55.423
Unstable angina rest causes resolution of both the patient symptoms and the ECG abnormalities

83
00:04:55.935 --> 00:04:59.775
And in fact when these patients are asymptomatic they usually have normal ECGs

84
00:05:01.311 --> 00:05:05.663
Silent ischemia occurs when a patient has ECG findings consistent with ischemia

85
00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:08.223
But they lack the characteristic chest pain

86
00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:11.295
Ischemia without corresponding Angelina

87
00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:13.087
Is more common in diabetics

88
00:05:13.343 --> 00:05:15.135
Possibly due to diabetic neuropathy

89
00:05:15.647 --> 00:05:17.695
As well as females and the elderly

90
00:05:18.975 --> 00:05:23.839
Aside from stable angina there's another important ischemic syndrome called variant angina

91
00:05:24.095 --> 00:05:25.887
Also known as Prinzmetal angina

92
00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:32.543
This is a syndrome in which focal spasm of a coronary artery cuts off myocardial oxygen supply

93
00:05:32.799 --> 00:05:35.103
Which causes ischemia an episodic Angelina

94
00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:37.919
The mechanism is unclear

95
00:05:38.175 --> 00:05:40.991
But it is not related to atherosclerosis plaques

96
00:05:42.015 --> 00:05:46.623
Where a stable angina is caused by the inability to meet the oxygen demand of exertion

97
00:05:47.391 --> 00:05:50.463
Prinzmetal angina is completely in oxygen supply problem

98
00:05:51.487 --> 00:05:55.583
For this reason it often occurs at rest without any exertional trigger

99
00:05:56.607 --> 00:06:01.215
The sub endocardial ischemia causes St depressions and T wave inversions on the ECG

100
00:06:01.983 --> 00:06:05.055
But the spasm can be severe enough to cause transmural ischemia

101
00:06:05.311 --> 00:06:07.359
So the ECG may show st-elevation

102
00:06:08.383 --> 00:06:13.247
However there is no necrosis so symptoms and ECG changes are transient and reversible

103
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:16.319
Although the underlying causes unknown

104
00:06:16.575 --> 00:06:19.647
Triggers include tobacco cocaine and triptans

105
00:06:20.671 --> 00:06:23.487
The treatment is calcium channel blockers and nitrates

106
00:06:23.743 --> 00:06:26.047
Activate or dilate the coronaries and reverse the spasm

107
00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:27.583
In addition to smoking cessation

108
00:06:28.863 --> 00:06:35.007
So now that you've established the Bob has a history of stable angina you ask him what was different about today that prompted

109
00:06:35.263 --> 00:06:35.775
Need to visit

110
00:06:36.543 --> 00:06:41.663
He says that he was walking calmly through his house when he experienced a sudden onset of crushing chest pressure

111
00:06:42.431 --> 00:06:46.015
He sat down and you took nitroglycerin but the pain didn't get better

112
00:06:46.783 --> 00:06:49.599
You called nine-one-one when he became unable to catch his breath

113
00:06:50.367 --> 00:06:53.439
Now you're concerned the Bob is having an acute coronary syndrome

114
00:06:54.463 --> 00:06:57.791
So what differentiates ischemic syndromes from acute coronary syndromes

115
00:06:58.303 --> 00:07:01.119
Well ischemia is an oxygen supply and demand problem

116
00:07:01.375 --> 00:07:07.263
Acute coronary syndromes are distinguished by athrosclerotic plaque rupture leading to coronary thrombosis

117
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:11.871
The standard progression goes from a normal blood vessel to a fatty streak

118
00:07:12.127 --> 00:07:14.943
Which can progress to Forman athrosclerotic plaque

119
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:19.039
This plaque can other become obstructive which would cause stable angina

120
00:07:19.551 --> 00:07:22.367
Or the black can rupture leading to an acute coronary syndrome

121
00:07:23.135 --> 00:07:27.231
Plaque rupture often occurs even before the plaque causes symptomatic destruction

122
00:07:28.255 --> 00:07:32.863
Thrombus formation is dangerous as you can cause partial or complete occlusion of a coronary artery

123
00:07:33.631 --> 00:07:36.447
This will cause ischemia that does not simply resolved with rest

124
00:07:36.703 --> 00:07:41.055
An ischemia may be severe enough to cause sub endocardial or transmural infarction

125
00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:46.687
Infection causes the leak of intracellular proteins such as troponin and ck-mb

126
00:07:46.943 --> 00:07:47.711
Into the blood

127
00:07:48.223 --> 00:07:52.063
So the presence of these proteins in the blood is used as a marker for myocardial necrosis

128
00:07:53.343 --> 00:07:56.927
The progression of ischemia to irreversible infarction takes about 20 minutes

129
00:07:57.951 --> 00:08:04.095
Acute coronary syndromes are broken down into unstable angina and stemi nstemi all of which are caused by plaque rupture

130
00:08:04.351 --> 00:08:05.631
Usher and coronary thrombosis

131
00:08:06.911 --> 00:08:09.983
Unstable angina is defined as any new onset chest pain

132
00:08:10.495 --> 00:08:12.031
Any chest pain that occurs at rest

133
00:08:12.543 --> 00:08:16.383
Or any change in the quality like the frequency or duration of engine

134
00:08:16.639 --> 00:08:17.919
At lower levels of exertion

135
00:08:18.943 --> 00:08:23.551
It is caused by plaque rupture and thrombosis that causes partial occlusion of a coronary artery

136
00:08:24.575 --> 00:08:27.391
This leads to the reversible sub endocardial ischemia

137
00:08:27.647 --> 00:08:29.951
Causing ST depression and T wave inversion

138
00:08:30.463 --> 00:08:34.559
However there was no necrosis so biomarkers such as troponin Czar negative

139
00:08:35.583 --> 00:08:37.887
Unstable angina is a precursor to an MI

140
00:08:39.935 --> 00:08:43.519
Nstemi stands for non-st elevation myocardial infarction

141
00:08:43.775 --> 00:08:49.919
It is caused by plaque rupture and thrombosis leading to partial occlusion of a coronary artery that is severe enough to cause

142
00:08:50.175 --> 00:08:51.711
Call sub endocardial infarction

143
00:08:52.735 --> 00:08:57.343
It can also occur from complete occlusion of the coronary artery that causes sub endocardial infarction

144
00:08:57.599 --> 00:09:01.439
You delete an area with enough collateral flow to prevent transmural infarction

145
00:09:03.231 --> 00:09:06.047
This will also appears St depressions and T wave inversion

146
00:09:06.303 --> 00:09:10.143
But because there is irreversible infarction the monocytes Valley proteins

147
00:09:10.655 --> 00:09:13.727
So their blood will be positive for troponin and ck-mb

148
00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:18.591
Stemi stands for st-elevation myocardial infarction

149
00:09:19.615 --> 00:09:23.967
This occurs when a completely occlusive coronary thrombosis causes transmural necrosis

150
00:09:24.223 --> 00:09:26.015
Which appears as St elevations

151
00:09:26.271 --> 00:09:28.063
With positive biomarkers of necrosis

152
00:09:29.343 --> 00:09:32.159
There's a typical progression of ECG changes during a stemi

153
00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:36.511
Initial EUC hyperacute T waves which are wide-based

154
00:09:37.023 --> 00:09:38.559
Tall relative to the r wave

155
00:09:39.071 --> 00:09:42.399
And often localized to the region supplied by the culprit vessel

156
00:09:43.423 --> 00:09:47.519
This should not be confused with peaked t-waves would you see with hyperkalemia

157
00:09:48.543 --> 00:09:51.615
Peaked t-waves are tall and narrow with a sharp Peak

158
00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:52.895
Enterprising diffusely

159
00:09:53.663 --> 00:09:56.991
The hyperacute T waves quickly evolve into st-elevation

160
00:09:57.759 --> 00:09:59.039
Over several hours

161
00:09:59.295 --> 00:10:02.367
Q waves begin to form and the r wave amplitude decreases

162
00:10:02.623 --> 00:10:05.695
Because the dead myocardium is not conducting electrical impulses

163
00:10:06.975 --> 00:10:09.535
Over the first few days the T waves begin to invert

164
00:10:09.791 --> 00:10:10.815
Anokiwave deepen

165
00:10:11.839 --> 00:10:14.655
Within a few more days the st-elevation normalize

166
00:10:14.911 --> 00:10:15.935
Leaving Q waves

167
00:10:16.191 --> 00:10:17.215
And T wave inversions

168
00:10:17.983 --> 00:10:20.543
The T wave inversions May resolve over a period of weeks

169
00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:23.615
And the Q waves will be the only permanent sign of the semi

170
00:10:24.639 --> 00:10:30.527
Often you should use the show st-elevation will also show St depressions in one or more other leads

171
00:10:30.783 --> 00:10:32.575
Which are known as reciprocal changes

172
00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:34.623
The causes unclear

173
00:10:34.879 --> 00:10:40.511
What the reciprocal St depressions do not indicate separate sub endocardial ischemia in addition to the stemi

174
00:10:41.535 --> 00:10:44.863
The inferior leads in the lateral leads 10 to show reciprocal changes

175
00:10:45.119 --> 00:10:49.215
Such that in inferior wall stemi will show inferior St elevations

176
00:10:49.471 --> 00:10:51.263
With lateral ST depression

177
00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:52.287
And vice versa

178
00:10:53.055 --> 00:10:56.127
Reciprocal changes are less likely with an anterior MI

179
00:10:57.151 --> 00:11:03.295
The presence of reciprocal St depressions are important because it confirms the stemi diagnosis with high specificity

180
00:11:03.551 --> 00:11:06.367
And also indicates a significant risk for poor outcome

181
00:11:07.903 --> 00:11:10.207
How to recognize a posterior wall stemi

182
00:11:10.975 --> 00:11:13.791
There would be st-elevation in the posterior leads

183
00:11:14.047 --> 00:11:17.119
But we don't routinely put ECG leads on the patient's back

184
00:11:18.143 --> 00:11:21.471
The answer is that we look for reciprocal changes in the anterior leads

185
00:11:22.751 --> 00:11:28.639
Opposed to your am I is diagnosed by St depressions and tall are waves in Lee's V1 through V3

186
00:11:29.663 --> 00:11:34.015
The tall are waves are essentially the inverse of the deep Q waves that you would expect

187
00:11:34.271 --> 00:11:35.295
If they were supposed to release

188
00:11:37.087 --> 00:11:40.159
This example shows St elevations in the inferior leads

189
00:11:40.415 --> 00:11:41.439
2 3 and avf

190
00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:44.767
Along with reciprocal St depressions in the lateral leads

191
00:11:45.023 --> 00:11:46.047
1 and AVL

192
00:11:47.839 --> 00:11:52.703
So Bob has chest pain that is occurring with minimal exertion and fails to resolve with rest

193
00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:55.263
Which is different from his chronic stable angina

194
00:11:56.031 --> 00:11:58.847
This would classify as a change in duration of Angelina

195
00:11:59.359 --> 00:12:01.151
So you diagnose him with unstable engine

196
00:12:02.175 --> 00:12:06.527
Is ECG shows nonspecific T wave changes in leads V1 through V4

197
00:12:07.807 --> 00:12:11.135
Is blood is drawn and lab results show an elevated troponin

198
00:12:12.927 --> 00:12:15.487
You go to notify Bob that he's having a heart attack

199
00:12:15.743 --> 00:12:21.887
And when you look up at the monitor you see that his rhythm strip shows obvious St elevation in leads V1 through V4

200
00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:27.263
Let's talk briefly about the management of a stemi

201
00:12:28.031 --> 00:12:32.639
The defender of therapy is reperfusion by unblocking the culprit coronary artery

202
00:12:33.663 --> 00:12:36.735
This is best achieved by percutaneous coronary intervention

203
00:12:36.991 --> 00:12:37.759
PCI

204
00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:42.111
This involves bringing the patient to the cath lab for angiography

205
00:12:42.367 --> 00:12:44.159
With angioplasty and stenting

206
00:12:44.415 --> 00:12:46.975
Ideally within 90 minutes from stemi diagnosis

207
00:12:48.511 --> 00:12:49.791
If this is not possible

208
00:12:50.303 --> 00:12:52.095
TPA should be administered to bust

209
00:12:52.351 --> 00:12:52.863
Thrombus

210
00:12:53.887 --> 00:12:57.727
And finally is a patient's coronary lesions are too expensive for stenting

211
00:12:58.239 --> 00:12:59.775
A coronary artery bypass graft

212
00:13:00.031 --> 00:13:03.103
Or cabbage should be performed by cardiothoracic surgeon

213
00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:07.967
Patient should be medically optimized while preparing for definitive treatment

214
00:13:08.735 --> 00:13:11.551
They should have a continuous ECG to monitor for arrhythmias

215
00:13:12.319 --> 00:13:13.343
They should be on bed rest

216
00:13:13.599 --> 00:13:15.647
To minimize cardiac oxygen demand

217
00:13:15.903 --> 00:13:18.719
With supplemental oxygen to maximize oxygen supply

218
00:13:19.743 --> 00:13:21.279
Morphine will help with the pain

219
00:13:21.535 --> 00:13:23.327
Which will also decrease oxygen demand

220
00:13:25.119 --> 00:13:27.679
Beta blockers are crucial because they will slow down the heart

221
00:13:27.935 --> 00:13:29.471
Which decreases oxygen demand

222
00:13:30.495 --> 00:13:33.567
Slowing down the heart also prolongs the duration of diastole

223
00:13:34.079 --> 00:13:35.615
Which is when the coronary arteries fill

224
00:13:36.127 --> 00:13:37.919
So it increases oxygen supply

225
00:13:39.199 --> 00:13:42.271
Beta blockers also decrease the excitability of the heart

226
00:13:42.527 --> 00:13:43.807
Which may prevent arrhythmias

227
00:13:44.575 --> 00:13:48.671
In addition beta blockers prevent post-mi remodeling of The myocardium

228
00:13:49.695 --> 00:13:53.535
However if a patient is in cardiogenic shock from the acute coronary syndrome

229
00:13:53.791 --> 00:13:55.327
Beta blockers are contraindicated

230
00:13:55.583 --> 00:13:57.887
As they can cause further cardiovascular collapse

231
00:13:59.679 --> 00:14:03.263
Nitrates dilate the coronary arteries which improves oxygen supply

232
00:14:04.287 --> 00:14:07.103
Trevino dilation they also decreased venous return

233
00:14:07.359 --> 00:14:08.895
Which reduces oxygen demand

234
00:14:09.151 --> 00:14:11.967
And also prevents further pulmonary vascular congestion

235
00:14:13.503 --> 00:14:17.343
Crucially anti thrombolytic agents are used to prevent progression of a thrombus

236
00:14:18.367 --> 00:14:24.511
Antiplatelet agents such as aspirin Clopidogrel or abciximab should be used in addition to anticoagulant

237
00:14:26.559 --> 00:14:32.703
ACE inhibitors promote vasodilation and decrease afterload by Block in the formation of Angiotensin II

238
00:14:33.215 --> 00:14:37.823
And decreases preload by inhibiting aldosterone dependent sodium and fluid retention

239
00:14:39.103 --> 00:14:44.223
Dropping preload and afterload decreases oxygen demand and also prevents harmful ventricular remodeling

240
00:14:45.759 --> 00:14:49.855
Statin should be used for plaque stabilization and for their anti-inflammatory effect

241
00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:51.903
And should be continued long-term

242
00:14:52.159 --> 00:14:54.207
To decrease the progression of atherosclerosis

243
00:14:57.535 --> 00:15:02.655
Bob was treated with all the appropriate medications before being wheeled up to the cath lab for PCI

244
00:15:03.679 --> 00:15:05.727
As you expected from zcg findings

245
00:15:05.983 --> 00:15:09.567
Angiography showed complete occlusion of the proximal LED

246
00:15:10.335 --> 00:15:12.127
Angioplasty opened up the artery

247
00:15:12.639 --> 00:15:15.199
And a drug-eluting stent was used to keep it Peyton

248
00:15:15.967 --> 00:15:18.527
Recovered uneventfully over the next few days

249
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:20.575
About a month later

250
00:15:20.831 --> 00:15:22.367
He falls over this cardiologist

251
00:15:22.623 --> 00:15:24.671
To see how the am I affected his heart function

252
00:15:26.207 --> 00:15:28.511
Systolic function of the heart is Quantified

253
00:15:28.767 --> 00:15:29.791
Using the ejection fracture

254
00:15:30.303 --> 00:15:34.911
Which is defined as the stroke volume or end-diastolic volume - end-systolic volume

255
00:15:35.423 --> 00:15:37.215
Divided by the end diastolic volume

256
00:15:38.495 --> 00:15:41.567
Conceptually it is the amount of blood ejected in One Beat

257
00:15:41.823 --> 00:15:44.127
Out of the total amount of blood that fills the left ventricle

258
00:15:45.151 --> 00:15:47.967
Normal EF is 55 to 75%

259
00:15:48.479 --> 00:15:52.063
And systolic heart failure is defined as an EF less than 40%

260
00:15:53.599 --> 00:15:55.647
The EF is measured by echocardiogram

261
00:15:55.903 --> 00:15:56.927
But interesting Li

262
00:15:57.183 --> 00:16:00.255
There are three ECG findings that indicate original CF

263
00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:03.071
It's a patient's ECG has Q waves

264
00:16:03.327 --> 00:16:05.887
Then that indicates dead myocardium that is not contract

265
00:16:06.399 --> 00:16:08.191
You can assume that the EF is reduced

266
00:16:09.215 --> 00:16:11.519
Also a low voltage QRS complex

267
00:16:11.775 --> 00:16:13.567
Indicate decrease electrical activity

268
00:16:14.335 --> 00:16:17.663
Left bundle branch block indicates A disruption in the conduction system

269
00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:20.223
If a patient has these features

270
00:16:20.479 --> 00:16:22.015
They may have a reduced EF

271
00:16:22.271 --> 00:16:24.063
And the absence of any of those features

272
00:16:24.319 --> 00:16:26.367
Make systolic heart failure less likely

273
00:16:27.903 --> 00:16:30.975
Pause ECG shows persistent Q waves in the anterior leads

274
00:16:31.231 --> 00:16:33.023
As well as a left bundle branch block

275
00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:35.327
It's your concern that is EF will be reduced

276
00:16:35.839 --> 00:16:38.399
You confirm this with an echo which unfortunately

277
00:16:38.655 --> 00:16:40.191
Chosen EF of 33%

278
00:16:40.959 --> 00:16:46.847
Bob returns 3D a few weeks later with a different sharp chest pain that is worse when he takes a deep breath

279
00:16:47.871 --> 00:16:49.407
You suspect pericarditis

280
00:16:49.663 --> 00:16:51.455
Which is inflammation of the pericardium

281
00:16:52.223 --> 00:16:53.247
It has many causes

282
00:16:53.503 --> 00:16:54.783
Including post-mi

283
00:16:55.039 --> 00:16:58.879
What can be immediate due to inflammation spreading from the necrotic myocardium

284
00:16:59.135 --> 00:17:00.927
Or can we do to Dressler syndrome

285
00:17:01.183 --> 00:17:06.047
Which is autoimmune pericarditis that occurs Weeks Later which is the likely cause and Bob Case

286
00:17:07.071 --> 00:17:09.375
Pericarditis can also be due to infection

287
00:17:09.631 --> 00:17:12.191
Particularly by Coxsackie virus or tuberculosis

288
00:17:12.959 --> 00:17:14.239
Take me to the neoplasia

289
00:17:14.751 --> 00:17:17.823
Autoimmune diseases such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis

290
00:17:18.591 --> 00:17:21.151
Kidney failure such as uremic pericarditis

291
00:17:21.663 --> 00:17:23.199
In addition to radiation therapy

292
00:17:24.479 --> 00:17:29.343
Clinically it presents with sharp chest pain that is pleuritic meaning worse with deep inspiration

293
00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:32.671
And positional meaning is better with sitting up and leaning forward

294
00:17:33.439 --> 00:17:35.487
It is treated with anti-inflammatories

295
00:17:35.743 --> 00:17:37.535
NSAIDs and colchicine

296
00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:39.839
And usually resolves completely in a few weeks

297
00:17:41.375 --> 00:17:45.983
On ECG pericarditis causes diffuse St elevations and PR depression

298
00:17:46.495 --> 00:17:49.055
Mean the segment between the P wave and the QRS complex

299
00:17:49.311 --> 00:17:50.335
Is below the Baseline

300
00:17:51.359 --> 00:17:54.431
Because of the SD elevations it can be mistaken for a stemi

301
00:17:54.687 --> 00:17:56.223
Which is managed completely differently

302
00:17:56.991 --> 00:18:00.063
If you see St elevations always look to see if there diffuse

303
00:18:00.319 --> 00:18:01.343
Like in pericarditis

304
00:18:01.599 --> 00:18:03.391
Or following anatomical pattern

305
00:18:03.647 --> 00:18:04.671
Like in a stemi

306
00:18:06.207 --> 00:18:09.535
Pericarditis is often accompanied by a pericardial effusion

307
00:18:09.791 --> 00:18:12.351
Which is a fluid accumulation in the pericardial space

308
00:18:13.631 --> 00:18:18.239
This plant's electrical signal and cause a low voltage QRS complex on ECG

309
00:18:18.751 --> 00:18:22.335
Meaning of QRS amplitude is less than 5 mm in the limb leads

310
00:18:22.591 --> 00:18:24.895
Or less than 10 mm in a precordial leads

311
00:18:25.919 --> 00:18:30.783
In a large effusion the heart may actually swing back and forth while floating in pericardial fluid

312
00:18:31.039 --> 00:18:33.855
Which causes the height of the QRS complex to very

313
00:18:34.111 --> 00:18:34.879
From beat to beat

314
00:18:35.135 --> 00:18:36.671
Known as electrical alternans

315
00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:41.791
When a pericardial effusion becomes large enough it will compress the heart

316
00:18:42.559 --> 00:18:45.119
This prevents the chambers from expanding during filling

317
00:18:45.375 --> 00:18:47.679
Cosmic drop in stroke volume and cardiac output

318
00:18:48.703 --> 00:18:50.495
This is called a cardiac tamponade

319
00:18:51.263 --> 00:18:54.079
The outcome is Becks Triad of hypotension

320
00:18:54.335 --> 00:18:55.103
Jvd

321
00:18:55.359 --> 00:18:56.639
And distant heart sounds

322
00:18:56.895 --> 00:18:58.943
As well as possible pulsus paradoxus

323
00:19:00.223 --> 00:19:04.831
It is treated by draining the pericardial fluid with a needle via pericardiocentesis

324
00:19:05.087 --> 00:19:05.855
Or surgically

325
00:19:06.111 --> 00:19:07.391
Via pericardial window
