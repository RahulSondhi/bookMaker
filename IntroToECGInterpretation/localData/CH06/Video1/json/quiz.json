With hypotension, the pressure in the aorta is decreased. This means that the pressure gradient is decreased, causing decreased blood flow and oxygen supply.\n\nB - Anemia means a low hemoglobin concentration, which indicates that the blood cannot carry as much oxygen. This decreases the oxygen content, and thus the oxygen supply to the heart.\n\nC - Tachycardia causes an increased metabolic rate in the myocardium, which means an increased oxygen demand.\n\nD - In aortic stenosis, the left ventricle has to work a lot harder to eject blood through a stenotic opening. This leads to increased wall tension, which means increased oxygen demand.\n\nE - Although ischemia is often caused by atherosclerotic plaques within the coronary arteries, ischemia can be caused by any condition that decreases oxygen supply or increases oxygen demand.\n"]},{"type":"mc","questionText":"Unstable angina includes:\n\n\n\n\n\n","answerText":["New-onset chest pain","Chest pain at rest","Increased frequency\/duration of angina","All of the above",""],"correctAnswer":"4","startTime":518.67246076073,"wrongTime":"0","startTimeSet":true,"wrongTimeSet":true,"expoText":["","","","Explanation: All of these scenarios are considered unstable angina.",""]},{"type":"mc","questionText":"On physical exam during an MI, you would expect to find all of the following, EXCEPT:","answerText":["Hypertension","Tachypnea with bibasilar crackles","S4","Chest wall tenderness","JVD"],"correctAnswer":"4","startTime":554.58410880118,"wrongTime":"0","startTimeSet":true,"wrongTimeSet":true,"expoText":["","","","Explanation:\nWhen palpation of the chest wall causes tenderness, this is called reproducible chest pain. Reproducible chest pain is much more likely to be due to musculoskeletal etiology, such as costochondritis. The visceral pain of an MI is unlikely to be reproducible by palpation.\n\nA - Hypertension can occur due to the sympathetic surge. Hypotension is also possible if the MI is severe and the patient goes into cardiogenic shock.\n\nB - When the left ventricle cannot pump effectively, the pressure is transmitted back to the pulmonary vasculature. This causes pulmonary vascular congestion, pulmonary edema, and pleural effusions. These can cause tachypnea and bibasilar crackles.\n\nC - An S4 occurs when the atria contract, forcing blood against stiff ventricles. Since ischemia causes impaired diastolic relaxation of the ventricles, they will be stiff and you may hear an S4.\n\nE - If the right ventricle is involved (either by direct ischemia to the right ventricle or secondary to left ventricular failure), then the pressure will be transmitted back to the right atria, the SVC, the brachiocephalic veins, and then the jugular veins. Increased pressure in the jugular veins causes JVD.\n",""]},{"type":"mc","questionText":"What differentiates an NSTEMI from a STEMI?\n\n\n\n\n","answerText":["Severity of symptoms","Duration of symptoms","Troponin leak","ECG changes",""],"correctAnswer":"4","startTime":706.68050050192,"wrongTime":"0","startTimeSet":true,"wrongTimeSet":true,"expoText":["","","","Explanation: STEMI has ST elevations, while NSTEMI shows ST depressions and T wave inversions.\n\nA - Symptoms may be worse with STEMI, but symptom severity is not used for diagnostic purposes\n\nB - Symptoms may last longer in a STEMI, but symptom duration is not used for diagnostic purposes\n\nC - Troponin leak occurs in both NSTEMI and STEMI, so it is not used to distinguish between the two\n",""]},{"type":"mc","questionText":"What artery and vascular territory are you concerned about?\n","answerText":["RCA - inferior wall","LAD - anterior wall","LCX - lateral wall","",""],"correctAnswer":"2","startTime":727.80499934925,"wrongTime":"0","startTimeSet":true,"wrongTimeSet":true,"expoText":["","Explanation: Leads V1-V4 overlay the anterior wall, which is supplied by the LAD.
