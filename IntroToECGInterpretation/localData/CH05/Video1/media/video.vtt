00:00:00.768 --> 00:00:03.840
We're going to step up the Acuity and talk about ventricular tachycardia

2
00:00:04.352 --> 00:00:07.424
Which are often life-threatening and can cause sudden cardiac death

3
00:00:09.216 --> 00:00:15.104
As stated previously atrial and ventricular arrhythmias are separated based on the width of the QRS complex

4
00:00:16.128 --> 00:00:19.200
Atrial arrhythmias connect to the native conduction system

5
00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:20.992
Cosmic crisp QRS interval

6
00:00:22.528 --> 00:00:26.112
Ventricular arrhythmias do not connect to the native conduction system

7
00:00:26.368 --> 00:00:29.696
And the impulses travel slowly being my site to my site spread

8
00:00:29.952 --> 00:00:31.488
So the QRS is widened

9
00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:36.352
What start with premature ventricular contractions or PVC

10
00:00:36.864 --> 00:00:41.472
Which occur when an irritable Focus within the ventricle gets excited and spontaneously fires

11
00:00:42.496 --> 00:00:45.056
The PVC is not related to an atrial impulse

12
00:00:45.312 --> 00:00:47.360
So the QRS has no preceding P wave

13
00:00:48.128 --> 00:00:48.896
The impulse

14
00:00:49.152 --> 00:00:53.760
Spread slowly throughout the ventricles which causes an abnormally wide QRS complex

15
00:00:54.016 --> 00:00:55.040
With high amplitude

16
00:00:56.064 --> 00:01:00.672
PVC typically have the opposite polarity compared to the normal surrounding QRS complexes

17
00:01:01.952 --> 00:01:05.280
Let's take a look at this example which has three obvious PVCs

18
00:01:06.048 --> 00:01:08.608
There certainly wide complexes with high amplitudes

19
00:01:08.864 --> 00:01:10.400
And they lack preceding P wave

20
00:01:11.168 --> 00:01:13.472
The polarities opposite from the surrounding complex

21
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.616
For example in lead avf the QRS complexes are mostly negative but the PVC is positive

22
00:01:21.152 --> 00:01:24.992
1 of ventricular Focus fires it spreads in all directions throughout the ventricles

23
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.112
So you can use your knowledge of vectors and leave to determine the location of the abnormal Focus

24
00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:34.464
In this example the PVC is positive in the inferior leads

25
00:01:34.976 --> 00:01:40.352
So we know that is originating in the superior portion of the ventricles and is spreading inferior Li

26
00:01:40.608 --> 00:01:41.632
Towards those weeds

27
00:01:42.656 --> 00:01:43.680
The answer Leeds

28
00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:47.264
Have a positive deflection in the left lateral leads have a negative deflection

29
00:01:47.776 --> 00:01:53.408
So we can infer that this PVC originated in the left posterior Superior region of the ventricles

30
00:01:53.664 --> 00:01:55.200
And it's spreading right word

31
00:01:55.456 --> 00:01:57.504
Anteriorly and inferiorly

32
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.624
If the impulse starts in the left ventricle and spreads to the right ventricle

33
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.928
It is as if the right bundle branch is blocked

34
00:02:05.184 --> 00:02:08.256
And the QRS complex can have a right bundle branch block pattern

35
00:02:09.024 --> 00:02:10.304
The opposite is also true

36
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.912
A PVC originating in the right ventricle will show a left bundle branch block pattern

37
00:02:16.704 --> 00:02:20.032
When every other beat is a PVC that is termed bigeminy

38
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.616
When every third beat is a PVC that is called trigeminy

39
00:02:24.384 --> 00:02:27.968
This should not be confused with couplets which are two consecutive PVCs

40
00:02:28.224 --> 00:02:30.528
Or triplets Witcher 3 consecutive PVCs

41
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.880
PVCs are very common even healthy patients

42
00:02:35.392 --> 00:02:36.928
May have no significance at all

43
00:02:37.184 --> 00:02:37.952
Typically

44
00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:39.488
Are not noticed by the patient

45
00:02:40.256 --> 00:02:46.400
However increasingly frequent PVCs can be a sign of underlying heart disease and may warrant further investigation

46
00:02:47.424 --> 00:02:52.032
In addition frequent PVCs can deteriorate into v-tach which will talk about next

47
00:02:53.312 --> 00:02:55.360
Although PVCs are mainly asymptomatic

48
00:02:55.872 --> 00:02:57.664
Some patients may experience palpitations

49
00:02:58.432 --> 00:03:01.760
Interesting lie they do not feel a palpitation with the PVC

50
00:03:02.016 --> 00:03:04.832
But instead patient fulfill palpitation with the following be

51
00:03:05.856 --> 00:03:08.672
What's separate atrial activity and ventricular activity

52
00:03:09.696 --> 00:03:11.232
As the PVC is firing

53
00:03:11.488 --> 00:03:14.816
The SA node is also firing an Impulse throughout the Atria

54
00:03:15.584 --> 00:03:18.656
This causes the P wave to be buried within the PVC

55
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.544
When the atrial impulse reaches the ventricles the ventricles are still refractory from the PVC

56
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.848
So the atrial impulse is extinguished

57
00:03:27.616 --> 00:03:29.920
After that there's a compensatory pause

58
00:03:30.176 --> 00:03:32.736
To wait for the next P wave to activate the ventricles

59
00:03:34.016 --> 00:03:37.344
During this pause there's increase time for ventricular filling

60
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.928
Or preload so the following beat has an increased stroke volume

61
00:03:41.696 --> 00:03:42.976
The compensatory pause

62
00:03:43.232 --> 00:03:47.584
Plus the increase stroke volume of the following deed is experienced as a palpitation

63
00:03:48.608 --> 00:03:51.936
These patients should be reassured that occasional PVCs are harmless

64
00:03:52.448 --> 00:03:54.240
But if the palpitations are bothersome

65
00:03:54.496 --> 00:03:56.800
Treatment with beta blockers can decrease their frequency

66
00:03:58.592 --> 00:04:02.176
Ventricular tachycardia is defined as three or more PVCs in a row

67
00:04:02.944 --> 00:04:07.552
It will appear as a ventricular arrhythmia meaning of wide QRS and the absence of p waves

68
00:04:07.808 --> 00:04:10.880
With a rate of 120 to 200 beats per minute

69
00:04:11.904 --> 00:04:17.024
Hey usually indicates a significant underlying heart disease and can be caused by ischemia infarction

70
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.047
Heart failure

71
00:04:18.303 --> 00:04:19.839
Ventricular hypertrophy

72
00:04:20.095 --> 00:04:21.375
Congenital diseases

73
00:04:21.631 --> 00:04:22.655
And valvular disease

74
00:04:24.447 --> 00:04:26.751
Vtac is divided into two categories

75
00:04:27.007 --> 00:04:29.311
Sustained v-tach and non sustained v-tach

76
00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:35.199
If the arrhythmia last more than 30 seconds causes severe symptoms or requires treatment

77
00:04:35.455 --> 00:04:35.967
To terminate it

78
00:04:36.223 --> 00:04:38.527
Did it meets criteria for sustained v-tach

79
00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:43.391
If it lasts less than 30 seconds and resolve on its own without intervention

80
00:04:43.647 --> 00:04:45.695
Then it is labeled non sustained v-tach

81
00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:50.815
Non sustained v-tach is usually asymptomatic and may not need any treatment

82
00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:53.631
Music is further categorized

83
00:04:53.887 --> 00:04:54.911
Buy QRS morphology

84
00:04:55.935 --> 00:04:59.775
Monomorphic v-tach means that each QRS complex looks similar

85
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:05.919
And is typically caused by scar from a myocardial infarction that is cause re-entry circuit within the ventricle

86
00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.295
Polymorphic v-tach means that the QRS complexes are changing any regular

87
00:05:11.551 --> 00:05:14.367
And it is typically caused by multiple ectopic foci

88
00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:17.183
Usually due to acute ischemia or infarction

89
00:05:18.207 --> 00:05:24.351
Sustained polymorphic v-tach is extremely dangerous as it will usually degenerate into v-fib which is fatal without me

90
00:05:24.607 --> 00:05:25.119
Media treatment

91
00:05:26.143 --> 00:05:27.423
Take a look at this ECG

92
00:05:27.935 --> 00:05:31.775
It shows frequent PVCs that degenerate into monomorphic v-tach

93
00:05:32.543 --> 00:05:37.407
It may look chaotic but hopefully you can appreciate that it is tachycardia with wide QRS complexes

94
00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:45.087
The symptoms of v-tach very and range from palpitations to pulmonary edema to syncope to cardiac arrest

95
00:05:45.855 --> 00:05:47.903
The degree of symptoms depends on the rate

96
00:05:48.927 --> 00:05:52.255
If the arrhythmia is so rapid that the ventricles don't have time to fill

97
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:58.655
Stroke volume will plummet and cardiac output will not be sufficient to maintain blood pressure and perfusion of vital organs

98
00:05:59.679 --> 00:06:02.751
Symptoms are also determined by the underlying condition of the heart

99
00:06:04.287 --> 00:06:05.567
Treatment depends on the severity

100
00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:07.615
If a patient loses their pulse

101
00:06:07.871 --> 00:06:10.175
Then you must go through the ACLS algorithm

102
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:14.271
Which includes CPR and defibrillation along with epinephrine and amiodarone

103
00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:20.671
This algorithm does not change if the VTEC deteriorates into v-fib as long as pulses are apps

104
00:06:21.951 --> 00:06:28.095
If the patient is hemodynamically stable consider synchronized cardioversion or treatment with anti-arrhythmic medications

105
00:06:28.351 --> 00:06:31.167
Such as amiodarone procainamide or sotalol

106
00:06:32.447 --> 00:06:34.495
If a patient of successfully resuscitated

107
00:06:34.751 --> 00:06:36.543
The underlying cause should be investigated

108
00:06:37.567 --> 00:06:40.127
If the patient is deemed to be high risk for recurrence

109
00:06:40.383 --> 00:06:44.479
They should have an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or ICD

110
00:06:44.735 --> 00:06:45.247
Inserted

111
00:06:47.295 --> 00:06:47.807
Torsades

112
00:06:48.063 --> 00:06:50.111
Which translates to twisting of the points

113
00:06:50.623 --> 00:06:54.975
Is a type of polymorphic v-tach in which the amplitude of the QRS complex is very

114
00:06:55.743 --> 00:06:59.327
It is due to irritable ventricular Foci that are competing

115
00:07:00.351 --> 00:07:06.495
From this example maybe you can see why it is described as a twisting of the QRS complexes around the Baseline

116
00:07:07.775 --> 00:07:11.871
You can see the amplitude shrinking smaller and smaller and then growing larger and larger again

117
00:07:13.151 --> 00:07:17.247
The most important risk factor for torsades is a prolonged QT interval

118
00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:19.039
Which has many potential causes

119
00:07:20.063 --> 00:07:21.855
Congenital Long QT syndrome

120
00:07:22.111 --> 00:07:25.951
Aware mutations in the genes coding for sodium and potassium channels

121
00:07:26.207 --> 00:07:30.303
Cause of prolonged action potential which causes a prolonged QT interval

122
00:07:31.583 --> 00:07:37.727
Electrolyte abnormalities such as hypokalemia hypocalcemia and importantly hypomagnesemia

123
00:07:38.239 --> 00:07:40.287
Can all cause a prolonged QT interval

124
00:07:41.311 --> 00:07:46.943
Many medications can cause a prolonged QT interval and I like to use the mnemonic A B C D and E

125
00:07:48.223 --> 00:07:50.271
A stands for anti-arrhythmic

126
00:07:50.527 --> 00:07:52.831
Specifically classes 1A & 3

127
00:07:53.855 --> 00:07:55.647
B stands for antibiotics

128
00:07:55.903 --> 00:07:56.927
Especially macrolide

129
00:07:58.207 --> 00:08:02.303
C stands for antipsychotics such as haloperidol

130
00:08:03.071 --> 00:08:06.399
D stands for antidepressants such as tcas

131
00:08:06.655 --> 00:08:09.471
Citalopram and escitalopram and Venlafaxine

132
00:08:10.495 --> 00:08:14.591
Annie stands for antiemetics such as ondansetron Zofran

133
00:08:16.127 --> 00:08:18.943
So imagine your patient has depression with psychotic features

134
00:08:19.455 --> 00:08:22.015
Treated with an antidepressant and antipsychotic

135
00:08:22.783 --> 00:08:27.647
In all comes into the Eda with an infection and you treat him with azithromycin a macrolide antibiotic

136
00:08:28.159 --> 00:08:31.743
Then he complained of nausea and you reflexively order small densitron

137
00:08:32.767 --> 00:08:37.119
Now he's on for medications that prolong the QT interval and he's at risk of torsades

138
00:08:38.911 --> 00:08:42.751
Torsades by itself is usually symptomatic with lightheadedness and syncope

139
00:08:43.775 --> 00:08:47.615
The real danger of torsades is potential degeneration into v-fib

140
00:08:47.871 --> 00:08:49.151
Which is a life-threatening condition

141
00:08:50.175 --> 00:08:52.479
Treatment involves correcting the underlying cause

142
00:08:52.735 --> 00:08:53.759
Such an electrolyte replace

143
00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:59.391
Magnesium sulfate should also be used even if the patient has a normal magnesium level

144
00:09:00.671 --> 00:09:03.999
And ICD should be placed in patients at risk of repeated torsades

145
00:09:04.255 --> 00:09:06.303
Such as those with congenital Long QT syndrome

146
00:09:08.351 --> 00:09:09.631
Finally we come to v-fib

147
00:09:10.143 --> 00:09:11.167
The most dangerous arrhythmia

148
00:09:12.191 --> 00:09:14.751
Multiple irritable ventricular Foci compete

149
00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:18.079
And the result of the loss of coordinated ventricular contraction

150
00:09:18.847 --> 00:09:20.639
This causes rapid cessation

151
00:09:20.895 --> 00:09:21.663
Cardiac output

152
00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:23.455
And death unless promptly treated

153
00:09:24.735 --> 00:09:28.831
It is often preceded by VTech that degenerates interview favor rest

154
00:09:29.855 --> 00:09:31.135
The ECG looks chaotic

155
00:09:31.391 --> 00:09:35.231
With no identifiable QRS wave forms as seen in this example

156
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:38.303
Treatment of CPR and defibrillation

157
00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:40.863
While trying to correct any underlying cause

158
00:09:41.887 --> 00:09:45.983
Anti-arrhythmic medications can be used in the immediate. To prevent recurrence
