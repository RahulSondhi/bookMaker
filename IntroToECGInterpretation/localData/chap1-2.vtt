1
00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:02.816
Now you know all about electrode placement and Li Direct

2
00:00:03.328 --> 00:00:04.352
So what does it all mean

3
00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.448
The ECG machine records electrical activity using the following convention

4
00:00:09.472 --> 00:00:11.008
Electrical activity moving towards

5
00:00:11.264 --> 00:00:14.080
The positive end of the electron is shown is an upward deflection

6
00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:15.104
On the ECG leads

7
00:00:16.384 --> 00:00:19.456
Electrical forces moving away from the positive end of the electrode

8
00:00:19.712 --> 00:00:20.736
Sean is a downward deflection

9
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.624
Electrical force moving perpendicular to the electrode will have biphasic isoelectric deflection

10
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.416
Or maybe no deflection

11
00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:34.048
Electrical forces moving exactly parallel to the electrode will have the greatest amp

12
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.888
Although straightest using lead one only

13
00:00:38.656 --> 00:00:41.472
Remember this week goes from the right arm towards the left arm

14
00:00:42.752 --> 00:00:45.312
If the electrical forces are moving towards the patients left

15
00:00:45.568 --> 00:00:48.128
Parallel and towards the positive end of the electrode

16
00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.176
Milby a large upward deflection

17
00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:55.808
If the electrical forces are moving towards the patients left but not exactly parallel to lead

18
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.136
And there will be an offer deflection but it will be of lesser magnitude

19
00:01:00.672 --> 00:01:03.488
If the electrical forces are moving away from the positive end

20
00:01:03.744 --> 00:01:06.048
Or towards the right arm in the crankcase of Lead 1

21
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.584
Then reflection

22
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.608
Will be downward

23
00:01:09.632 --> 00:01:13.728
And finally if the electrical forces are moving perpendicular to the positive end of the electrode

24
00:01:13.984 --> 00:01:15.776
Such a straight downward in the case of Lead 1

25
00:01:16.288 --> 00:01:18.336
Vanilla bean isoelectric deflection

26
00:01:18.592 --> 00:01:19.104
Orno deflect

27
00:01:20.384 --> 00:01:21.408
By comparing the deflection

28
00:01:21.664 --> 00:01:23.712
And all 12-lead shown on ECG

29
00:01:23.968 --> 00:01:27.808
You can determine exactly which direction impulses traveling at any given moment

30
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.368
I want to make sure that the factions are clear

31
00:01:31.136 --> 00:01:33.184
Since the force to move an inferior Li

32
00:01:33.696 --> 00:01:36.256
They're traveling towards the positive ends of the inferior leads

33
00:01:36.512 --> 00:01:37.536
2 3 and avf

34
00:01:38.304 --> 00:01:40.608
This Workshop as positive flexion

35
00:01:41.376 --> 00:01:46.496
In a normal Rhythm depolarization begins in SA node at the Superior part of the right atrium

36
00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:49.568
And spreads downwards during atrial depolarization

37
00:01:50.336 --> 00:01:55.712
Therefore during normal atrial depolarization the inferior leads should show positive deflection

38
00:01:56.736 --> 00:01:59.296
This is a fundamental concept that will come again soon

39
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.624
Now it's time to learn the major deflections of an ECG

40
00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:07.488
First comes a P wave which represents atrial depolarization

41
00:02:08.256 --> 00:02:11.584
As I already showed depolarization translates to physical contracture

42
00:02:12.096 --> 00:02:13.632
Do calcium dependent calcium release

43
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.752
However by convention Easton juice don't show contraction they show depolarization

44
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.080
You can only actually visualize contraction through images

45
00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:23.616
Such as an echocardiogram

46
00:02:24.128 --> 00:02:26.688
It may be semantics and many people don't stick this convention

47
00:02:26.944 --> 00:02:28.480
But I feel is important to stink

48
00:02:29.504 --> 00:02:33.856
Do the conduction delay at the AV node the tracing returns to Baseline after the P wave

49
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.720
Next to see the QRS complex which is when the ventricles are depolarizing

50
00:02:39.488 --> 00:02:42.048
The tracing return to Baseline again after QRS

51
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.680
And lastly you see the T wave which represents the repolarization or relaxation of the ventricles

52
00:02:48.704 --> 00:02:50.752
Atrial repolarization is not seen

53
00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:55.616
Because it was hidden within the QRS complex since the Atria are relaxing while the ventricles are Contracting

54
00:02:56.896 --> 00:02:58.688
Let's break down the QRS complex

55
00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:02.016
Any initial downward deflection is AQ wave

56
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.600
The first upper deflection is called an R wave

57
00:03:06.624 --> 00:03:10.208
Any downward deflection pass Baseline after an R wave is an essay

58
00:03:11.488 --> 00:03:15.584
Any subsequent upward deflection after an S Wave is called in R prime wave

59
00:03:16.608 --> 00:03:21.216
Many QRS complexes have an initial deflection that is upward enough to not have a Q wave

60
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.776
There many different QRS pattern

61
00:03:24.544 --> 00:03:26.080
Do you have a normal QRS

62
00:03:26.336 --> 00:03:27.872
Where the initial deflection is downward

63
00:03:28.128 --> 00:03:28.640
The Q wave

64
00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:32.992
Then there's a positive deflection the r-wave and then finally another downward deflection

65
00:03:33.248 --> 00:03:34.784
Pass Baseline the S Wave

66
00:03:36.064 --> 00:03:37.600
You can also have an R wave

67
00:03:37.856 --> 00:03:40.416
Which is simply an upward deflection that returns to Baseline

68
00:03:41.184 --> 00:03:44.000
Notice that there are no downward deflection below Baseline

69
00:03:44.256 --> 00:03:46.048
So there are no Q or S waves

70
00:03:46.816 --> 00:03:48.864
There's also the Q waves

71
00:03:49.376 --> 00:03:52.448
Which is an initial downward deflection that returns to Baseline

72
00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:57.056
I would call the Q wave but some people call this a QRS Wave by convention

73
00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.128
This one shows an initial upward deflect

74
00:04:00.384 --> 00:04:02.688
Action followed by a downward deflection past Baseline

75
00:04:02.944 --> 00:04:04.736
So this is called an RS wave

76
00:04:05.504 --> 00:04:07.040
You can also have this wave

77
00:04:07.296 --> 00:04:08.832
Which shows an initial upward deflection

78
00:04:09.088 --> 00:04:09.856
The r-wave

79
00:04:10.112 --> 00:04:11.904
Then a downward deflection Pass based on

80
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:12.928
The S Wave

81
00:04:13.184 --> 00:04:14.720
And finally another up or deflect

82
00:04:14.976 --> 00:04:16.512
Pass Baseline the are PrimeWay

83
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.351
Therefore this is called an rsr Prime pattern

84
00:04:20.607 --> 00:04:22.399
Also referred to as bunny ears

85
00:04:23.935 --> 00:04:30.079
Of course ventricular depolarization follow the conduction pathway that we described earlier including the right and left bundle branches

86
00:04:30.335 --> 00:04:32.639
McKendree cells and the ventricular myocytes and selves

87
00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:36.479
But ECGs don't show the depolarization of single myocytes

88
00:04:36.735 --> 00:04:39.551
They show the overall depolarization in a given Direction

89
00:04:40.575 --> 00:04:45.695
To make this clear the following explanation is talking about the average impulse Vector at a given point in time

90
00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:49.023
Keeping this in mind

91
00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:51.583
You should know that these varying QRS patterns exist

92
00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:55.167
Because ventricular depolarization does not occur in Only One Direction

93
00:04:55.935 --> 00:04:59.263
If for example the ventricles were simply activated from right to left

94
00:04:59.775 --> 00:05:01.311
Then the QRS would simply look like

95
00:05:01.567 --> 00:05:04.895
Tall R wave as the impulse travel towards the left lateral leads

96
00:05:05.151 --> 00:05:06.431
Such as V5 V6

97
00:05:06.687 --> 00:05:07.711
1 and AVL

98
00:05:08.223 --> 00:05:09.503
And I'm deep Q wave

99
00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.575
In AVR as the impulse travels away from the right

100
00:05:13.855 --> 00:05:16.159
Unfortunately it's a little more complicated than that

101
00:05:16.927 --> 00:05:21.535
Instead ventricular depolarization begins in the left side of the interventricular septum

102
00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:23.839
And then spreads downward and rightward

103
00:05:24.095 --> 00:05:25.375
Towards the right ventricle

104
00:05:26.143 --> 00:05:29.471
When the right and left ventricles are depolarizing the left ventricle dominant

105
00:05:29.727 --> 00:05:31.519
Because it has much thicker myocardium

106
00:05:32.543 --> 00:05:35.615
Does the overall electrical forces swing towards the left

107
00:05:36.383 --> 00:05:40.223
Once the entire myocardium is depolarized there is no longer any potential difference

108
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:42.783
So they were tracing returns to Baseline

109
00:05:43.551 --> 00:05:47.135
Illustrate this using lead one which again goes from the right arm to the left arm

110
00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:51.487
As the interventricular septum depolarizes from left to right

111
00:05:51.743 --> 00:05:55.327
The impulses moving away from the left arm which shows a small downward deflection

112
00:05:56.351 --> 00:06:00.703
As the overall impulse wins back the left is now moving towards the positive electrode

113
00:06:00.959 --> 00:06:03.007
So you see a strong positive deflection

114
00:06:03.263 --> 00:06:06.847
Then the tracing return to Baseline what's depolarization is complete

115
00:06:07.359 --> 00:06:09.407
You can see this forms a QR wave

116
00:06:10.175 --> 00:06:12.479
Nothing about what this would look like for Li 3

117
00:06:13.247 --> 00:06:14.783
Li 3 is an inferior lead

118
00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:20.415
And the initial downward and right word impulse should be directed exactly towards the positive electrode for lead 3

119
00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:23.231
This should appear as positive deflection

120
00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:26.303
As overall forces continue downward

121
00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:27.071
It's the left

122
00:06:27.327 --> 00:06:31.167
It is traveling roughly perpendicular to the lead so they're chasing returns to Baseline

123
00:06:31.935 --> 00:06:34.751
And as the impulse travels towards the left lateral Direction

124
00:06:35.263 --> 00:06:37.311
It is traveling away from the positive electrode

125
00:06:37.567 --> 00:06:38.847
So there should be negative deflection

126
00:06:39.871 --> 00:06:42.175
You should recognize that this is an RS wave

127
00:06:42.687 --> 00:06:48.831
So you can see that the exact same and pulse shows up differently in different leads because each lead has a different perspective

128
00:06:49.087 --> 00:06:49.855
The same impulse

129
00:06:50.623 --> 00:06:54.207
Now we have to consider the same concept in the transverse plane of the chest leads

130
00:06:55.231 --> 00:06:58.559
It's important to remember that the right ventricle is anterior to left ventricle

131
00:06:59.071 --> 00:07:04.191
Does as the impulse initially travels from the left side of the interventricular septum towards the right ventricle

132
00:07:04.447 --> 00:07:07.007
The vector points both rightward and anteriorly

133
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:08.543
This would be

134
00:07:08.799 --> 00:07:10.079
Towards lead V1

135
00:07:10.335 --> 00:07:11.615
Sean is a positive deflection

136
00:07:11.871 --> 00:07:14.431
And away from lead V6 Sean is a -2 Flex

137
00:07:15.711 --> 00:07:19.039
As the impulse twins back the left ventricle the vector points

138
00:07:19.295 --> 00:07:20.831
Leftward and posteriorly

139
00:07:21.855 --> 00:07:24.415
This is away from b1 shown as a negative deflection

140
00:07:24.671 --> 00:07:26.975
Taurus V6 shown as a positive deflection

141
00:07:27.999 --> 00:07:29.279
Leads V2 V3

142
00:07:29.535 --> 00:07:32.863
The 405 show the intermediate stages as the r-wave

143
00:07:33.119 --> 00:07:33.887
Grows taller

144
00:07:34.399 --> 00:07:35.935
This is turn R wave progression

145
00:07:37.215 --> 00:07:41.823
The lead in which the height of the r-wave becomes a greater magnitude than the depth of the S Wave

146
00:07:42.079 --> 00:07:43.103
It's called the transition

147
00:07:43.615 --> 00:07:45.663
Which is usually lead V3 or V4

148
00:07:46.687 --> 00:07:51.807
I think the best way to explain this is simply that the main Vector during ventricular depolarization is to the left

149
00:07:52.063 --> 00:07:54.367
Through the thick of myocardium in the left ventricle

150
00:07:54.623 --> 00:07:57.951
Does the further left the lead is the higher the r-wave should be

151
00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:02.559
These examples show why QRS complexes have different patterns

152
00:08:02.815 --> 00:08:04.351
Different leads in A Normal Heart

153
00:08:05.119 --> 00:08:07.423
I hope it is clear that within a single ECG

154
00:08:07.679 --> 00:08:09.727
YouTube can show different QRS pattern

155
00:08:09.983 --> 00:08:12.543
Because each lead has a different perspective of the same impulse
