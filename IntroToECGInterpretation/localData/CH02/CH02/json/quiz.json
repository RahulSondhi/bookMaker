Therefore, any impulse travelling inferiorly will be moving towards these leads, which shows up as a positive deflection.\n",""],"correctAnswer":4,"startTime":90.774045,"wrongTime":90.774045,"startTimeSet":true,"wrongTimeSet":true},{"type":"mc","questionText":"Ventricular systole is shown in which of the following waves:","answerText":["P wave","QRS complex","T wave","Not shown on ECG",""],"expoText":["","","","",""],"correctAnswer":2,"startTime":175.983468,"wrongTime":175.983468,"startTimeSet":true,"wrongTimeSet":true},{"type":"mc","questionText":"How would you label the following waveform?

Then, there is a positive deflection - an R wave. It then returns to baseline without any subsequent downward deflection past baseline, so there is no S wave. Thus, this is a QR wave.","","","",""],"correctAnswer":1,"startTime":263.394726,"wrongTime":263.394726,"startTimeSet":true,"wrongTimeSet":true},{"type":"mc","questionText":"Ventricular depolarization begins at which of the following locations:","answerText":["Right lateral wall","Left lateral wall","Posterior wall","Interventricular septum","Anterior wall"],"expoText":["","","","Explanation: Ventricular depolarization begins with depolarization of the interventricular septum from left to right.",""],"correctAnswer":4,"startTime":410.269779,"wrongTime":410.269779,"startTimeSet":true,"wrongTimeSet":true}],"duration":"00:08:16.23"}
