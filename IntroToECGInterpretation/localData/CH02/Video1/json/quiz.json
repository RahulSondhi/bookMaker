You now know to get an echocardiogram, which may show that the patient needs a valve repair. The ECG provided an important clue towards the correct diagnosis.\n","","",""],"correctAnswer":2,"startTime":131.881814106,"wrongTime":131.678595703,"startTimeSet":true,"wrongTimeSet":true},{"type":"mc","questionText":"A patient with long-standing tricuspid stenosis would be expected to have:","answerText":["The first component of the P wave in lead II will be tall, with a mostly negative deflection in lead V1","The second component of the P wave in lead II will be tall, with a mostly negative deflection in lead V1","The first component of the P wave in lead II will be tall, with a mostly positive deflection in lead V1","The second component of the P wave in lead II will be tall, with a mostly positive deflection in lead V1",""],"expoText":["","","Explanation: Long-standing tricuspid stenosis would cause elevated pressures in the right atrium, which could cause right atrial enlargement. Right atrial enlargement shows an exaggerated first component of the P wave, which would be a tall P wave in lead II and a mostly positive P wave in lead V1.\n","",""],"correctAnswer":3,"startTime":146.549646703,"wrongTime":146.549646703,"startTimeSet":true,"wrongTimeSet":true},{"type":"mc","questionText":"Which of the following would NOT cause LVH?","answerText":["Untreated hypertension","Aortic stenosis","Pulmonary Hypertension","Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy",""],"expoText":["","","Explanation: Anything that chronically increases left ventricular afterload can cause LVH, because the myocardium has to work harder when pumping against a higher pressure. Pulmonary hypertension would increase RIGHT ventricular afterload, and would thus cause RVH, not LVH.\n","",""],"correctAnswer":3,"startTime":302.74811295,"wrongTime":302.74811295,"startTimeSet":true,"wrongTimeSet":true},{"type":"mc","questionText":"In LBBB, the left ventricle depolarizes before the right ventricle.","answerText":["True","False","","",""],"expoText":["","Explanation: When the left bundle branch is blocked, the electrical impulse cannot reach the left ventricle via the normal pathway. The right ventricle depolarizes rapidly via the normal pathway, but the left ventricle depolarizes via slow myocyte-to-myocyte spread. Thus, the right ventricle is depolarized before the left ventricle.\n","","",""],"correctAnswer":2,"startTime":361.366127955,"wrongTime":361.366127955,"startTimeSet":true,"wrongTimeSet":true},{"type":"mc","questionText":"RBBB have which of the following patterns?","answerText":["Lead V1 - QS pattern with sharp downward deflection"," Lead V1 - R\/S ratio > 1","Lead V1 - rSR\u2019 pattern with R\u2019>r ","Lead V6 - monomorphic R wave",""],"expoText":["","","Explanation: Choices A and D would be indicative of LBBB, not RBBB. Choice B would be correct if it said lead V6, not V1. As an aside, the left bundle branch divides into the left anterior fascicle and the left posterior fascicle. Either of these divisions can become blocked, which causes a unique QRS pattern, but these are beyond the scope of medical school training. If you know RBBB and LBBB well, then you are doing great.","",""],"correctAnswer":3,"startTime":624.241851188,"wrongTime":624.241851188,"startTimeSet":true,"wrongTimeSet":true},{"type":"mc","questionText":"Which leads show pathologic Q waves?","answerText":["Leads I and aVL"," Lead aVR","Leads II, III, and aVF","Leads V1-V3","None of the above"],"expoText":["","","Explanation: Do you see the huge pathologic Q waves in leads II, III, aVF?
