1
00:00:00.768 --> 00:00:03.328
Now let's talk about abnormalities specific

2
00:00:03.584 --> 00:00:05.632
To the P QRS or T waves

3
00:00:06.912 --> 00:00:13.056
The P wave is really the superimposed deflections of right atrial depolarization followed quickly by left atrial Depot

4
00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:13.824
Polarization

5
00:00:14.592 --> 00:00:15.360
Mb2

6
00:00:15.616 --> 00:00:18.432
Right atrial depolarization causes a positive deflection

7
00:00:18.688 --> 00:00:22.784
And then left atrial depolarization quickly cause II positive deflection

8
00:00:23.552 --> 00:00:25.600
These get combined into one positive lecture

9
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.232
And leave the one right atrial depolarization still cause a positive deflection

10
00:00:31.488 --> 00:00:34.816
Left atrial depolarization actually causes a negative deflect

11
00:00:35.328 --> 00:00:38.144
To the posterior forces moving away from lead V1

12
00:00:38.912 --> 00:00:42.240
Please get combined into a biphasic or like a sine wave

13
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.080
Now imagine that one Atrium becomes enlarged

14
00:00:47.104 --> 00:00:48.640
What would that look like on an ECG

15
00:00:49.408 --> 00:00:51.200
In right atrial enlargement

16
00:00:51.456 --> 00:00:53.504
The first component of the P we will be exaggerated

17
00:00:54.016 --> 00:00:59.648
So the P wave in lead II will the large initial positive deflection due to the enlarged right atrium

18
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.952
Followed by a normal left atrial deflection

19
00:01:03.488 --> 00:01:08.864
The P wave in lead V1 will have a large upward deflection followed by the normal downward deflection

20
00:01:09.888 --> 00:01:10.400
Simply

21
00:01:10.656 --> 00:01:15.008
If the P wave in lead 2 is taller than 2.5 mm you'll right atrium large

22
00:01:16.288 --> 00:01:18.336
Left atrial enlargement is just the office

23
00:01:19.104 --> 00:01:20.128
The second component of the

24
00:01:20.384 --> 00:01:21.408
Z-Wave will be exaggerated

25
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.432
Does

26
00:01:22.688 --> 00:01:28.576
Lead II will show a normal initial upward deflection followed by a larger upper deflection corresponding

27
00:01:28.832 --> 00:01:30.112
The enlarged left atrium

28
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.744
Levy one will show normal initial upward deflection followed by a large downward effects

29
00:01:36.768 --> 00:01:39.840
Simply if the P wave in lead V1 is mostly negative

30
00:01:40.352 --> 00:01:43.680
And greater than 1 mm deep and greater than 1 mm wide

31
00:01:44.192 --> 00:01:45.728
Then you have left atrial enlargement

32
00:01:47.776 --> 00:01:49.056
As a clinical correlate

33
00:01:49.312 --> 00:01:54.432
Mitral valve stenosis is usually a long-term sequelae of rheumatic fever due to group a strep

34
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.296
The stenotic opening caused an outflow obstruction from the left atrium to the left ventricle

35
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.392
Essentially blanket stuck in the left atrium causing to enlarge

36
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.304
The patient may have symptoms of pulmonary congestion and the physical exam May yield an opening snap and diastolic

37
00:02:12.352 --> 00:02:16.960
The ECG shows left atrial enlargement which is consistent with your presumed diagnosis

38
00:02:17.728 --> 00:02:19.520
You now know to get an echocardiogram

39
00:02:19.776 --> 00:02:21.824
Which may show that the patient needs a valve repair

40
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.920
The ECG provided an important clue towards the correct diagnosis

41
00:02:28.224 --> 00:02:30.016
Now let's talk about the QRS complex

42
00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:34.880
Since the QRS complex corresponds to ventricular depolarization

43
00:02:35.136 --> 00:02:38.976
It tells you about ventricular hypertrophy as well as ventricular conduction block

44
00:02:40.512 --> 00:02:43.072
Let's talk about left and right ventricular hypertrophy

45
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.936
In hypertrophic chamber you would expect exaggerated electrical stimulation

46
00:02:48.704 --> 00:02:51.264
The left ventricle is normally much thicker than the Right Punch

47
00:02:52.032 --> 00:02:53.568
So left ventricular hypertrophy

48
00:02:53.824 --> 00:02:55.616
Is really just an exaggeration of normal

49
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.712
Believes that overlay the left ventricle 1 and AVL

50
00:03:00.224 --> 00:03:01.760
Should have enlarged R waves

51
00:03:02.528 --> 00:03:04.576
The leaves that are opposite for left ventricle

52
00:03:04.832 --> 00:03:05.856
V1 and V2

53
00:03:06.112 --> 00:03:07.648
Should show very deep S wave

54
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.512
Of course there are specific criteria for diagnosing LVH

55
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.352
The quickest method which we will call the AVL criteria

56
00:03:16.608 --> 00:03:18.912
Is to measure the height of the r wave in lead AVL

57
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.728
If it is greater than 11 mm tall

58
00:03:21.984 --> 00:03:23.520
Tinnitus diagnostic of LVH

59
00:03:24.288 --> 00:03:24.800
However

60
00:03:25.056 --> 00:03:26.592
If it is less than 11 mm

61
00:03:26.848 --> 00:03:28.384
That still doesn't rule out LVH

62
00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:30.688
Sophie R wave in lead AVL

63
00:03:30.944 --> 00:03:37.088
Is less than 11 mm B of A high index of Suspicion for LVH then you can use the more formal Cornell

64
00:03:37.344 --> 00:03:38.112
Voltage criteria

65
00:03:38.624 --> 00:03:39.392
4 L V8

66
00:03:40.928 --> 00:03:46.048
Count the height of the r wave in lead AVL and count the death of the S Wave in lead V3

67
00:03:46.304 --> 00:03:47.584
And add these values together

68
00:03:48.096 --> 00:03:50.912
In females if the sum is greater than 20 mm

69
00:03:51.168 --> 00:03:52.704
That is diagnostic of LVH

70
00:03:53.472 --> 00:03:57.312
In males the diagnosis requires this song is greater than 28 mm

71
00:03:58.592 --> 00:03:59.616
Take a look at this example

72
00:04:00.128 --> 00:04:04.480
The r-wave in AVL is about 13 to 14 mm above Baseline

73
00:04:04.736 --> 00:04:06.528
So this means criteria for LVH

74
00:04:08.064 --> 00:04:10.880
Right ventricular hypertrophy is the opposite of normal

75
00:04:11.392 --> 00:04:17.536
It should be no surprise that you would see right Axis deviation when the thick right ventricle is dominating the electrical

76
00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:18.303
Vector

77
00:04:19.071 --> 00:04:21.631
Every age is common in pulmonary hypertension

78
00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:24.447
Chronic lung diseases and pulmonic valve stenosis

79
00:04:25.215 --> 00:04:29.311
You should expect at the leads overlying the right ventricle V1 and V2

80
00:04:29.567 --> 00:04:30.847
Will have taller ways

81
00:04:31.615 --> 00:04:32.895
Rvh criteria

82
00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:35.199
Requires either in our way of that

83
00:04:35.455 --> 00:04:37.503
Bigger than S Wave in lead V1

84
00:04:38.015 --> 00:04:41.343
Or an R wave is greater than 7 mm tall and leave the wall

85
00:04:42.367 --> 00:04:48.255
It would not meet criteria if there was a right bundle branch block with a large are Prime with more on that in a minute

86
00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:54.143
As we discussed earlier that transition lead is where the r-wave is taller than s-wave is deep

87
00:04:55.423 --> 00:04:59.007
It normally occurs at lead V3 or before but with rvh

88
00:04:59.263 --> 00:05:01.823
Detransition lead maybe lead V1 or V2

89
00:05:05.663 --> 00:05:08.223
Now it's talk about ventricular conduction blocks

90
00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.527
Specifically right and left bundle branch block

91
00:05:11.807 --> 00:05:13.087
If the bundle branches are damaged

92
00:05:13.343 --> 00:05:16.671
Often due to ischemia electrical forces must find a new rap

93
00:05:16.927 --> 00:05:17.951
Teresa destination

94
00:05:18.975 --> 00:05:21.791
Rather than traveling rapidly through the purkinje fibers

95
00:05:22.047 --> 00:05:27.423
The effective ventricles is stimulated by slow myocyte to my side spread from the unaffected ventricle

96
00:05:28.191 --> 00:05:28.959
For example

97
00:05:29.215 --> 00:05:31.519
If the right bundle branch is blocked right ear

98
00:05:31.775 --> 00:05:34.847
The impulse travels rapidly down the left bundle branch

99
00:05:35.103 --> 00:05:35.871
To the left ventricle

100
00:05:36.127 --> 00:05:39.967
I'm from there The Impossible slowly from cell-to-cell to reach the right venture

101
00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:43.039
Left bundle branch block

102
00:05:43.295 --> 00:05:44.319
Is vice versa

103
00:05:45.343 --> 00:05:47.647
Dispose down ventricular depolarization

104
00:05:47.903 --> 00:05:49.695
Crossing the QRS complex

105
00:05:49.951 --> 00:05:53.791
To widen Beyond 0.12 seconds or three small boxes

106
00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:56.607
Is the QRS interval is prolonged

107
00:05:56.863 --> 00:05:58.399
Then you look at the QRS pattern

108
00:05:58.655 --> 00:06:00.703
To determine where the conduction block is located

109
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:04.287
In right bundle branch block

110
00:06:04.543 --> 00:06:09.407
The average electrical Vector will start in the left side of the interventricular septum and spread to the right

111
00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.735
Then the left ventricular depolarization will dominate

112
00:06:12.991 --> 00:06:14.783
Causing the forces to swing for the left

113
00:06:15.551 --> 00:06:16.831
These are the same as in The Normal Heart

114
00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:22.975
However and right bundle branch block the impulse will reach the right ventricle slowly through my site to my site spread

115
00:06:23.487 --> 00:06:28.351
So by the time the impulse reaches the right ventricle the left ventricle is already depolarized

116
00:06:28.607 --> 00:06:30.399
So the rightward forces are unopposed

117
00:06:30.655 --> 00:06:32.191
Causing a final swing to the right

118
00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.007
Let's see how that would look

119
00:06:35.263 --> 00:06:36.799
In leads V1 V6

120
00:06:37.823 --> 00:06:42.431
Levy one will have a small positive deflection as the septum depolarizes towards the lead

121
00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:44.735
And then we'll have a large negative

122
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:46.783
Deflection as the forces swing to the left

123
00:06:47.551 --> 00:06:51.135
Finally over another positive deflection is a vector swings back to the right

124
00:06:52.415 --> 00:06:53.951
This terminal R prime waves

125
00:06:54.207 --> 00:06:55.999
Crucial for recognizing right bundle branch

126
00:06:57.023 --> 00:06:59.839
Best rsr prime wave is known as a bunny ears

127
00:07:01.631 --> 00:07:03.167
Lead V6 will show the opposite

128
00:07:03.935 --> 00:07:05.215
Small negative deflection

129
00:07:05.727 --> 00:07:07.007
Then a positive deflection of

130
00:07:07.263 --> 00:07:08.287
Force of swing to the left

131
00:07:08.543 --> 00:07:09.567
And then another negative

132
00:07:10.079 --> 00:07:11.615
Is the fourth string back to the right

133
00:07:13.407 --> 00:07:18.015
Remember that lead V1 is considered the golden lead when evaluating for conduction block

134
00:07:18.783 --> 00:07:21.599
The actual criteria for right bundle branch block are

135
00:07:21.855 --> 00:07:26.975
Everyone has an rsr Prime pattern where they are prime is greater than the r

136
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:28.767
And leave V6

137
00:07:29.023 --> 00:07:31.327
Has an order s ratio greater than 1

138
00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:33.887
Let's take a look at this example

139
00:07:34.655 --> 00:07:38.239
The first step is to recognize the QRS duration is prolonged

140
00:07:38.751 --> 00:07:42.847
I count about four small boxes which corresponds to 160 milliseconds

141
00:07:43.871 --> 00:07:46.943
So you know that there is an intraventricular conduction delay

142
00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:51.807
You can see that lead V1 has a tiny aurawave than an s-wave

143
00:07:52.063 --> 00:07:54.367
And then a tall terminal R prime wave

144
00:07:54.879 --> 00:07:59.231
This meets the criteria for an rsr Prime pattern where are prime is greater than our

145
00:07:59.743 --> 00:08:02.815
Then you can confirm by noticing that in lead V6

146
00:08:03.071 --> 00:08:05.375
The r-wave is taller than the S Wave is deep

147
00:08:05.887 --> 00:08:10.239
I recognize in this pattern you can diagnose the conduction delay as a right bundle branch block

148
00:08:11.775 --> 00:08:14.079
Right bundle branch block so generally benign

149
00:08:14.335 --> 00:08:15.615
Do not require treatment

150
00:08:17.151 --> 00:08:20.479
Left bundle branch blocks cause an even more abnormal QRS pattern

151
00:08:21.247 --> 00:08:25.855
Left bundle branch usually causes the interventricular septum to depolarize from left to right

152
00:08:26.367 --> 00:08:28.671
When the left bundle branch is blocked

153
00:08:29.183 --> 00:08:29.951
The right bundle branch

154
00:08:30.207 --> 00:08:32.767
Will depolarize the septum from right to left

155
00:08:33.535 --> 00:08:39.679
This leftward Vector will show up as an initial downward deflection lead V1 and an initial upward to play

156
00:08:41.727 --> 00:08:44.031
The right ventricle is then depolarized raps

157
00:08:46.079 --> 00:08:50.943
This will cause a positive deflection in leave the one and a negative deflection in leave the sex

158
00:08:51.967 --> 00:08:57.855
They're slow my site tomorrow side spread the impulse finally reaches the left ventricle causing the vector to swing back the left

159
00:08:58.623 --> 00:09:02.975
This will show up as a negative deflection 31 and a positive deflection in V6

160
00:09:05.023 --> 00:09:08.095
This translates into the following criteria for a left bundle branch

161
00:09:09.887 --> 00:09:10.911
Lead V1

162
00:09:11.167 --> 00:09:13.471
She show a small R wave in an RS pattern

163
00:09:13.727 --> 00:09:14.239
Or

164
00:09:14.495 --> 00:09:16.799
A QS pattern with a sharp downward swave

165
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:18.335
Also known as vampire

166
00:09:19.615 --> 00:09:23.199
And lead V6 should have a monomorphic r wave with no Sy

167
00:09:24.479 --> 00:09:26.527
Let's look at this example of left bundle branch

168
00:09:27.295 --> 00:09:28.831
Again first you have to notice it

169
00:09:29.087 --> 00:09:33.951
The QRS interval is prolonged at about 3 and 1/2 small boxes or 140

170
00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:38.303
Lead V1 has a QS pattern with a sharp downward deflection

171
00:09:39.071 --> 00:09:42.399
Weird V6 shows a monomorphic r wave with no s wave

172
00:09:42.911 --> 00:09:44.447
So you're looking at a left bundle branch

173
00:09:47.007 --> 00:09:51.103
Left bundle branch blocks are more clinically significant than right bundle branch block

174
00:09:52.127 --> 00:09:53.151
Left bundle branch block

175
00:09:53.663 --> 00:09:57.247
Cause the normally crisp ventricular contraction to be uncoordinated

176
00:09:57.503 --> 00:09:58.271
Unsynchronized

177
00:09:58.527 --> 00:10:00.319
Which decreases pumping efficiency

178
00:10:01.343 --> 00:10:04.159
If the heart is otherwise healthy this has no clinical significance

179
00:10:04.671 --> 00:10:08.255
But if the heart is already struggling to maintain cardiac output

180
00:10:08.767 --> 00:10:10.303
Then a new left bundle branch block

181
00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:13.631
Can cause a clinically significant decline in cardiac function

182
00:10:14.655 --> 00:10:20.799
A new left bundle branch block requires a cardiac evaluation and symptomatic left bundle branch blocks may require

183
00:10:21.055 --> 00:10:23.615
Pacemaker to better synchronize ventricular contractions

184
00:10:24.895 --> 00:10:29.503
Finally when looking at the QRS complex it is crucial to look for pathologic Q waves

185
00:10:29.759 --> 00:10:32.319
A very high yield Topic in ECG interpretation

186
00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:35.135
As discussed previously

187
00:10:35.391 --> 00:10:39.487
Q waves are defined as an initial downward deflection of the QRS complex

188
00:10:40.255 --> 00:10:46.399
Smokey waves can be normal especially in Leeds V6 and AVL as the septum depolarize away from those

189
00:10:46.655 --> 00:10:47.423
Left lateral leads

190
00:10:48.191 --> 00:10:54.335
However large U waves defined as greater than 1 small box and duration and greater than 25% of the height of the

191
00:10:54.591 --> 00:10:55.103
QRS

192
00:10:55.359 --> 00:10:57.151
Are considered pathologic Q waves

193
00:10:58.175 --> 00:11:04.063
Pathologic Q waves are caused by previously infarcted tissue that no longer conducts electrical forces

194
00:11:04.575 --> 00:11:08.671
Therefore Q waves indicate a prior myocardial infarction

195
00:11:08.927 --> 00:11:11.487
And often persist for the rest of the patient's life

196
00:11:11.743 --> 00:11:14.303
Even if treatment causes successful reperfusion

197
00:11:15.327 --> 00:11:20.703
Often you will find pathologic Q waves on ECG use of patients reporting no cardiac history

198
00:11:21.471 --> 00:11:25.823
The patient may have had subtle symptoms that they ignored or attributed to indigestion

199
00:11:26.335 --> 00:11:29.151
So they have no idea that they have had a heart attack in the past

200
00:11:30.687 --> 00:11:31.199
Simply

201
00:11:31.455 --> 00:11:34.271
Q waves are bad indicate injured and dead heart

202
00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:38.879
And our waves are good and indicate healthy heart capable of conducting electricity

203
00:11:40.671 --> 00:11:43.487
Q waves appear in the specific location of the infarction

204
00:11:43.999 --> 00:11:47.839
An inferior wall Mi due to a blocked right coronary artery

205
00:11:48.095 --> 00:11:51.935
What cause permanent pathologic Q waves in leads 2 3 and avf

206
00:11:52.703 --> 00:11:56.031
Pathologic Q waves tell you not only that the patient has

207
00:11:56.287 --> 00:11:58.079
Previously had myocardial damage

208
00:11:58.335 --> 00:12:00.639
But also which coronary vessel was the culprit

209
00:12:01.663 --> 00:12:07.551
If the Q wave is in an isolated lead only for example in lead 2 but not leaves 3 and avf

210
00:12:08.063 --> 00:12:12.159
Then the Q waves probably not do the previous infarction and can be ignored

211
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:15.231
Also Q waves are normal in lead AVR

212
00:12:17.023 --> 00:12:18.303
Now let's talk about T wave

213
00:12:19.071 --> 00:12:20.863
If the QRS complex is upright

214
00:12:21.119 --> 00:12:23.167
Then the T wave should be upright as well

215
00:12:24.191 --> 00:12:30.335
If the Q R S and T waves are in different directions such as an upright QRS but a flipped T wave

216
00:12:30.591 --> 00:12:32.383
And that is called a T wave inversion

217
00:12:33.663 --> 00:12:36.479
Walk you waves are permanent signs of an old infarct

218
00:12:37.247 --> 00:12:40.575
T wave inversions are transient sign of reversible ischemia

219
00:12:41.343 --> 00:12:42.879
Patients with chronic angina

220
00:12:43.135 --> 00:12:46.463
May have T wave inversions on their ECG when they are symptomatic

221
00:12:46.719 --> 00:12:49.279
But they may have normal T waves when their symptoms resolved

222
00:12:50.047 --> 00:12:53.631
T wave inversions are quite common and their significance depends on contacts

223
00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:55.679
They may be normal variant

224
00:12:55.935 --> 00:12:59.519
But they also may be an early clue that The myocardium is ischemic

225
00:13:00.287 --> 00:13:01.311
Is important to note

226
00:13:01.823 --> 00:13:05.407
The children often have inverted T waves and leave the V 1 through 3 3

227
00:13:06.687 --> 00:13:11.039
The t-waves in leads V2 and V3 usually become upright by adulthood

228
00:13:11.295 --> 00:13:15.647
But T wave inversions May persist in lead V1 through adulthood which is considered normal

229
00:13:17.439 --> 00:13:20.511
This example shows inverted T waves essentially throughout

230
00:13:21.023 --> 00:13:24.607
Again this does not indicate infarction tissue but transient ischemia

231
00:13:25.631 --> 00:13:28.959
Something you should always be on the lookout for is a tall T wave

232
00:13:29.727 --> 00:13:32.287
Peaked t-waves are associated with hyperkalemia

233
00:13:32.543 --> 00:13:33.567
Which you can see here

234
00:13:34.335 --> 00:13:40.223
Peaked t-waves should be differentiated from hyperacute T waves which are associated with st-elevation MI

235
00:13:40.991 --> 00:13:46.111
We will discuss how to differentiate between peaked and hyperacute T waves in the ischemia module

236
00:13:47.135 --> 00:13:53.279
Finally medical student should know that you wave is an extra deflection after the T wave and usually indicate

237
00:13:53.535 --> 00:13:54.303
Hypokalemia

238
00:13:55.327 --> 00:13:57.119
Other changes with hypokalemia

239
00:13:57.375 --> 00:14:00.703
Include flattening of the T wave and ST segment depression

240
00:14:01.983 --> 00:14:05.823
In this example you can see the T wave here and then this other deflection afterward

241
00:14:06.335 --> 00:14:07.359
That's the new wave
