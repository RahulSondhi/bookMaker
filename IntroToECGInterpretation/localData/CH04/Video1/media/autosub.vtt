00:00:00.768 --> 00:00:06.912
Although this chapter on AV block look short and relatively simple it is actually high-heeled for both testing and

2
00:00:07.168 --> 00:00:07.936
Clinical purposes

3
00:00:08.704 --> 00:00:12.288
The AV conduction system includes the AV node bundle of His

4
00:00:12.544 --> 00:00:13.312
Bundle branches

5
00:00:13.824 --> 00:00:17.408
Therefore we are concerned with the connection between the Atria and the ventricles

6
00:00:17.664 --> 00:00:19.712
So we will focus on the PR interval

7
00:00:21.248 --> 00:00:25.088
Impaired conduction through the AV conduction system is broken up into first

8
00:00:25.344 --> 00:00:27.136
Second and third degree AV block

9
00:00:27.392 --> 00:00:29.184
Rocks which indicate increasing severity

10
00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:34.048
These blocks are generally caused by ischemia infarction of the conduction system

11
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.376
Age-related chronic degeneration of the conduction system

12
00:00:37.632 --> 00:00:38.656
Or medications

13
00:00:38.912 --> 00:00:40.704
Here in the northeastern United States

14
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.264
It is crucial to know the AV block is one of the

15
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.312
Feared consequences of Lyme's disease

16
00:00:45.824 --> 00:00:47.616
Although it is usually reversible with treatment

17
00:00:49.152 --> 00:00:55.296
First degree AV block is simply a delay at the AV node that prolongs the time between atrial depolarization and

18
00:00:55.552 --> 00:00:56.320
Ventricular depolarization

19
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.904
This appears as a prolonged PR interval

20
00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.720
Beyond 200 milliseconds are 5 small boxes

21
00:01:03.744 --> 00:01:07.072
Is completely benign and asymptomatic and it does not require treatment

22
00:01:08.352 --> 00:01:10.144
First degree AV block is very common

23
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.752
And is often due to a reversible ischemia and infarction or age-related degeneration

24
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.800
However certain medications

25
00:01:17.312 --> 00:01:19.872
Can cause reversible delay at the AV node

26
00:01:20.384 --> 00:01:26.528
For example beta-blockers and non dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers slow conduction through the AV node

27
00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.320
This is water used in a fee

28
00:01:29.088 --> 00:01:31.904
To limit the ventricular rate when the Atria are firing frantically

29
00:01:32.928 --> 00:01:36.512
So first degree AV block is actually unintended consequence of his Medicaid

30
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.936
I'm this ECG the start of the P wave to the start of the QRS complex spans about 7 small boxes

31
00:01:44.704 --> 00:01:50.592
Since each small box equals 40 milliseconds 7 small boxes corresponds to a PR interval

32
00:01:50.848 --> 00:01:52.384
I'm about 280

33
00:01:53.152 --> 00:01:56.992
This is significantly prolonged and indicates first degree AV block

34
00:01:58.272 --> 00:02:03.136
Second degree AV block is characterized by intermittent failure of the AV conduction system

35
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.696
This causes dropped Beats

36
00:02:05.952 --> 00:02:09.280
Which is when an atrial impulse is not conducted through to The ventricle

37
00:02:09.792 --> 00:02:14.144
Which appears as a P wave followed by no corresponding QRS complex

38
00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:16.448
Second degree AV block

39
00:02:16.704 --> 00:02:17.216
Is broken

40
00:02:17.472 --> 00:02:20.032
Into mobitz type 1 and mobitz type 2

41
00:02:21.312 --> 00:02:25.664
Mobitz type 1 second degree AV block is also called a wonky Bock block

42
00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:31.808
With each consecutive beat the PR interval grows longer and longer as the AV delay worsens

43
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.648
Then there was a drop beat indicating AV node failure

44
00:02:36.416 --> 00:02:41.536
After the drop beat the cycle starts fresh as the PR interval returns to its original duration

45
00:02:42.304 --> 00:02:43.584
The great mnemonic cuz

46
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.912
Longer longer longer block now you have a wenckebach

47
00:02:47.424 --> 00:02:51.520
Which describes the progressive lengthening of the PR interval preceding the drop beat

48
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.824
Lucky block block

49
00:02:54.336 --> 00:02:58.176
Is also benign and usually asymptomatic and does not require any treatment

50
00:02:58.688 --> 00:03:02.784
It can be totally normal and children or trained athletes with increased vagal tone

51
00:03:03.808 --> 00:03:06.368
The patient is experiencing bothersome symptoms

52
00:03:06.624 --> 00:03:10.464
Medications or pacemaker can be considered but this is rarely necessary

53
00:03:11.744 --> 00:03:14.304
Look at the Rhythm strip for lead II on the ccg

54
00:03:15.072 --> 00:03:17.376
The first beat has a very short PR interval

55
00:03:17.888 --> 00:03:21.216
Second beat has a PR interval of about 8 small boxes

56
00:03:21.472 --> 00:03:24.288
And the third beat has a PR interval of about 10 small boxes

57
00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.616
Then you see a P wave with a long pause afterwards

58
00:03:27.872 --> 00:03:29.408
Which represents the dropped beat

59
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.480
And then the cycle restarts with a short PR interval again

60
00:03:33.248 --> 00:03:36.064
This is the longer longer longer block of wenckebach

61
00:03:37.088 --> 00:03:37.856
If you'd like

62
00:03:38.112 --> 00:03:40.672
Pause the video and use the calipers in the interface

63
00:03:40.928 --> 00:03:43.488
To convince yourself of the change in the PR interval

64
00:03:44.512 --> 00:03:49.120
Mobitz type 2 second degree AV block is diagnosed when there is one or more drop beats

65
00:03:49.376 --> 00:03:51.680
Without the preceding lengthening of the PR interval

66
00:03:52.704 --> 00:03:55.008
The PR interval is relatively constant

67
00:03:55.264 --> 00:03:58.336
And then there's a P wave with no corresponding QRS complex

68
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.944
There may be a fixed ratio of conducted p waves to non conductor

69
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.712
And p waves

70
00:04:04.224 --> 00:04:06.784
For example 3 to 1 ratio would have

71
00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.160
Three p waves followed by QRS and then one P wave not fall by QRS

72
00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.488
When there are two sequential drop beats

73
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.047
This is called high-grade AV block

74
00:04:18.815 --> 00:04:19.839
Importantly

75
00:04:20.095 --> 00:04:25.727
The block is typically below the AV node in the bundle of hiss or Beyond which causes the QRS to be widened

76
00:04:27.263 --> 00:04:29.311
Mobitz type 2 can suddenly progressed

77
00:04:29.567 --> 00:04:30.591
Third degree heart block

78
00:04:30.847 --> 00:04:31.615
Which is dangerous

79
00:04:32.127 --> 00:04:33.151
Therefore these patients

80
00:04:33.407 --> 00:04:37.759
Require treatment with a permanent pacemaker even if they are completely asymptomatic

81
00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:40.575
Now look at the Rhythm strip

82
00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:42.623
Believe the one on this ECG

83
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:46.719
The PR interval remains constant at around 5 small boxes

84
00:04:47.487 --> 00:04:49.279
After the 4th QRS complex

85
00:04:49.791 --> 00:04:50.559
You see a P wave

86
00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:52.095
Followed by a long pause

87
00:04:52.863 --> 00:04:56.447
This dropbeat that is not preceded by lengthening of the PR interval

88
00:04:56.703 --> 00:04:59.775
Is diagnostic of second degree AV block mobitz type 2

89
00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:01.823
This patient is at risk

90
00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:06.175
Progression to third degree AV block and requires close monitoring and a pacemaker

91
00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.551
Third degree AV block is also called complete heart block

92
00:05:12.831 --> 00:05:16.927
It occurs when the connection between the Atria and the ventricles is completely blocked

93
00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:19.487
So that none of the atrial impulses are conducted

94
00:05:19.743 --> 00:05:22.303
2 through the ventricles causing the Atria and ventricles

95
00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:23.583
The contract independent

96
00:05:24.863 --> 00:05:27.935
The heart has many locations with prominent pacemaker activity

97
00:05:28.447 --> 00:05:31.007
However the SA node Fires at the fastest rate

98
00:05:31.263 --> 00:05:34.847
So it normally dominates and suppresses all other pacemaker activity

99
00:05:35.871 --> 00:05:39.455
If the SA node and the AV node cannot activate the ventricles

100
00:05:39.967 --> 00:05:42.527
The ventricles are activated by Escape Beats

101
00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.623
Meaning that the distal conducting system or cardiac myocytes themselves

102
00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:47.903
Initiating info

103
00:05:48.927 --> 00:05:51.999
This is exactly how the ventricles are activated in complete heart block

104
00:05:52.767 --> 00:05:56.095
If the proximal bundle of His acts as a pacemaker for the ventricles

105
00:05:56.607 --> 00:05:58.655
The QRS complex will be narrow

106
00:05:58.911 --> 00:06:00.959
At a rate of 40 to 60 beats per minute

107
00:06:01.471 --> 00:06:03.007
And this is called a junctional Escape worth

108
00:06:04.287 --> 00:06:06.335
If the pacemaker is even more distal

109
00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:08.383
The QRS complex will be widened

110
00:06:08.895 --> 00:06:11.455
And the ventricular rate will be 20 to 40 beats per minute

111
00:06:11.967 --> 00:06:14.015
This is called ventricular Escape rhythm

112
00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.647
So in complete heart block the SA node activates the Atria at a normal rate

113
00:06:19.903 --> 00:06:21.695
But these impulses cannot reach the bench

114
00:06:22.463 --> 00:06:27.327
So the Escape Rhythm activates the bench goals at a slow rate that is unrelated to the atrial rate

115
00:06:28.607 --> 00:06:30.911
This appears on an ECG as p waves

116
00:06:31.167 --> 00:06:33.215
With no relationship to the QRS complex

117
00:06:33.983 --> 00:06:35.775
Which is called AV dissociation

118
00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:39.615
The Atria and ventricles contract simultaneously

119
00:06:40.383 --> 00:06:42.687
Causing the p-wave to be hidden within the QRS come

120
00:06:45.247 --> 00:06:49.855
Unlike the other degrees of Av block complete heart block will almost always be symptomatic

121
00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:54.207
Ventricular Escape beats are too slow to maintain cardiac output

122
00:06:54.719 --> 00:06:58.047
Two patients typically experience symptomatic bradycardia causing

123
00:06:58.303 --> 00:06:58.815
Fatigue

124
00:06:59.071 --> 00:07:01.887
Dyspnea chest pain pre syncope syncope

125
00:07:02.143 --> 00:07:03.423
Or even cardiac arrest

126
00:07:04.703 --> 00:07:07.775
Slower ventricular rates are associated with more severe symptoms

127
00:07:08.287 --> 00:07:11.615
And patients with underlying heart disease will have a more severe presentation

128
00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:16.735
Patients with heart failure may present with an acute exacerbation of the heart failure Sim

129
00:07:18.783 --> 00:07:21.087
If a patient is hemodynamically unstable

130
00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:23.135
Then they should be treated with IV at

131
00:07:23.391 --> 00:07:26.207
Caffeine and transcutaneous or transvenous pacing

132
00:07:27.231 --> 00:07:28.255
Once stabilized

133
00:07:28.511 --> 00:07:29.791
Look for reversible causes

134
00:07:30.559 --> 00:07:32.607
If the heart block is deemed irreversible

135
00:07:32.863 --> 00:07:34.911
Then a permanent pacemaker should be implanted

136
00:07:35.167 --> 00:07:37.215
To maintain an adequate ventricular rate

137
00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:42.335
This example shows beautiful AV dissociation

138
00:07:42.847 --> 00:07:44.895
Especially in the Rhythm strip for lead to

139
00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:49.759
Identify all of the p waves and QRS complexes in the Rhythm strip

140
00:07:50.783 --> 00:07:56.927
If you use the calipers in the interface you'll notice that the P2P interval and QRS QRS interval

141
00:07:57.183 --> 00:07:57.695
Wisconsin

142
00:07:58.463 --> 00:08:01.279
The Atria are Contracting at a completely steady rate

143
00:08:01.535 --> 00:08:03.583
With two-and-a-half large boxes between them

144
00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:06.655
And the ventricles are Contracting at a different study rate

145
00:08:07.423 --> 00:08:12.031
The calipers will help you identify where the hidden p waves are buried within the QRS complex

146
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:15.871
So it looks like the ventricles are being activated

147
00:08:16.127 --> 00:08:17.919
Completely independently from the Atria

148
00:08:18.175 --> 00:08:23.039
I can't find any pattern that explains the relationship between the p waves and the QRS complexes

149
00:08:24.063 --> 00:08:27.391
Therefore we have the AV dissociation of complete heart block

150
00:08:28.671 --> 00:08:30.463
The QRS complex is narrow

151
00:08:30.719 --> 00:08:36.607
So we know the ventricles are being activated by junctional Escape Rhythm originating at the proximal bundle of His

152
00:08:37.631 --> 00:08:41.215
That means the Escape Rhythm should be about 40 to 60 beats per minute

153
00:08:41.471 --> 00:08:43.775
And what do you know it's exactly 50 beats per minute

154
00:08:45.055 --> 00:08:47.871
My favorite part of this ECG is that it also tells you

155
00:08:48.127 --> 00:08:49.407
The cause of the heart block

156
00:08:50.431 --> 00:08:55.039
I know we haven't gone over ischemia yet but perhaps you notice the st-elevation the inferior leads

157
00:08:55.295 --> 00:08:56.575
2 3 and avf

158
00:08:57.343 --> 00:09:01.695
This likely indicates an infarction in the territory supplied by the RCA

159
00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:05.791
Since the RCA gives off branches that feed the AV node

160
00:09:06.559 --> 00:09:12.447
Then an RCA lesion can cause infarction of the AV node which caused complete AV node Block in this case

161
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:17.055
So this ECG gave me the diagnosis of complete heart block

162
00:09:17.311 --> 00:09:18.591
As well as the etiology

163
00:09:19.103 --> 00:09:22.431
RCA infarction that involves the AV nodal artery
