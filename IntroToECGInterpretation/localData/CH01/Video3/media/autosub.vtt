00:00:00.256 --> 00:00:01.280
Navigate to The Fun Park

2
00:00:01.536 --> 00:00:02.560
Interpreting ECG

3
00:00:03.584 --> 00:00:05.632
ECG interpretation should be systematic

4
00:00:06.144 --> 00:00:08.960
Some messages will have abnormalities that jump off the page of you

5
00:00:09.472 --> 00:00:11.776
Anime only take a second term what's going on

6
00:00:12.544 --> 00:00:16.896
Before you can sign off on any ECG you must go through the entire sequence of interpretation

7
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.480
Sometimes an extremely subtle change can be the ticket

8
00:00:20.736 --> 00:00:21.504
2 diagnosis

9
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.320
So you have to make sure that no stone is left Unturned

10
00:00:25.344 --> 00:00:27.648
The ECG machine will print its own interpretation

11
00:00:27.904 --> 00:00:28.672
As you can see here

12
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.232
The machine will try to evaluate

13
00:00:31.488 --> 00:00:32.000
The rate

14
00:00:32.256 --> 00:00:32.768
Rhythm

15
00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:35.328
Intervals and even ischemic changes

16
00:00:36.096 --> 00:00:40.960
However it is absolutely critical for the stoop clinician to interpret and calculate these for themselves

17
00:00:41.472 --> 00:00:43.776
Asthma machine interpretation is often incorrect

18
00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.848
It can be tempting to use the machines a shortcut

19
00:00:47.104 --> 00:00:50.432
However machines will recognize interference as true reflections

20
00:00:50.688 --> 00:00:54.272
And may use this artifact to calculate intervals that are completely wrong

21
00:00:55.296 --> 00:00:57.600
I've seen heart attacks red is normal by the machine

22
00:00:57.856 --> 00:01:00.160
And I've seen normal ECGs read his heart attacks

23
00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:05.024
I cannot stress enough how important it is for you to interpret ECG for yourself

24
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.864
And only then can you consider using the machine interpretation as confirmation

25
00:01:09.888 --> 00:01:13.216
In fact you can see that the machine read this ECG is atrial flutter

26
00:01:13.728 --> 00:01:14.496
But is actually

27
00:01:14.752 --> 00:01:15.776
Sinus tachycardia

28
00:01:16.544 --> 00:01:19.616
If you trusted the machine interpretation that this is atrial flutter

29
00:01:19.872 --> 00:01:22.432
Then you may prescribe the wrong medications and harm the patient

30
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.296
This is a perfect example of why we shouldn't be relying on machines for ECG interpretation

31
00:01:28.832 --> 00:01:34.976
The last thing you should know before we dive into ECG interpretation is how the voltage and timing are shown on the ECG

32
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.792
An ECG is printed on a grid

33
00:01:38.304 --> 00:01:41.120
One small box is 1 mm in width and height

34
00:01:41.888 --> 00:01:46.496
5 small boxes make up one large box and large boxes are printed with much thicker lines

35
00:01:48.288 --> 00:01:50.080
The x axis corresponds to time

36
00:01:50.592 --> 00:01:53.664
An ECG is recorded at 25 mm per second

37
00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:54.944
And since one box

38
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.480
Is 1 mm width

39
00:01:56.736 --> 00:01:59.552
The ECG is recorded a 25 small boxes per second

40
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.928
Does one small box or 1 mm corresponds to 0.04 seconds

41
00:02:05.184 --> 00:02:07.488
And one large box or 5mm

42
00:02:07.744 --> 00:02:09.536
Corresponds to 0.2 seconds

43
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.352
The y-axis corresponds to voltage

44
00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.728
Normally one small box or one millimeter corresponds to one tenth of noble

45
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.824
So one large box corresponds to 5 10 in height

46
00:02:22.592 --> 00:02:23.360
Calibration

47
00:02:24.384 --> 00:02:29.248
Checking the height of the calibration signal is an often ignored first step of ECG interpretation

48
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.880
ECGs indicator calibration with A1 Melville signal at the beginning or end of the tracing

49
00:02:35.648 --> 00:02:40.768
I just told you that under normal circumstances each small box corresponds to a tenth of a millivolt in height

50
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.864
So the one Melville calibration signal corresponds to 10 small box

51
00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.144
As shown here

52
00:02:49.472 --> 00:02:54.080
However some heart problems can cause the ECG to have deflections of extreme magnitude

53
00:02:54.848 --> 00:02:57.408
Touch they don't fit on the page with this normal calibration

54
00:02:58.688 --> 00:03:04.832
The machine cuts the size of the deflection in half by having one small box correspond to 0.2 ml

55
00:03:05.088 --> 00:03:07.136
Instead of the normal 0.1 millivolts

56
00:03:07.904 --> 00:03:14.048
You can tell the calibration is changed because the one Melville calibration signal now spans five small boxes

57
00:03:14.304 --> 00:03:14.816
Instead of time

58
00:03:16.608 --> 00:03:17.632
Take a look at this ECG

59
00:03:18.144 --> 00:03:19.168
It looks strange doesn't it

60
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.240
The deflections look tiny here here here

61
00:03:23.008 --> 00:03:24.800
The weight is barely deviate from the Baseline

62
00:03:25.568 --> 00:03:30.176
At first look you probably think something is wrong with this patient heart to make that you said you look so abnormal

63
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.248
However take a look at the calibration signal

64
00:03:34.016 --> 00:03:36.320
It is only 2 and 1/2 small boxes tall

65
00:03:37.344 --> 00:03:40.928
Since we know the signal always corresponds to 1 Melville then we know that

66
00:03:41.184 --> 00:03:43.488
Two and a half boxes now equals 1

67
00:03:44.512 --> 00:03:49.888
This means that each small box is now 0.4 ml instead of the usual 0.1

68
00:03:50.656 --> 00:03:52.960
Now for example a reflection of

69
00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:57.056
0.8 millivolts corresponds to only two small boxes in height

70
00:03:57.312 --> 00:03:59.104
Instead of the normal rate small box

71
00:04:00.384 --> 00:04:02.432
This is why these deflections seem so small

72
00:04:03.456 --> 00:04:07.040
The person who set up the ECG machine enter the calibration incorrectly

73
00:04:07.552 --> 00:04:08.832
But racing is actually normal

74
00:04:09.088 --> 00:04:10.880
But you will only be able to determine this

75
00:04:11.136 --> 00:04:13.952
If you are diligent and noticed the abnormal calibration

76
00:04:14.976 --> 00:04:17.024
If this seems complicated then let me simplify

77
00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:21.375
If the calibration signal corresponds to 10 small boxes in height

78
00:04:22.143 --> 00:04:24.447
Can you have normal calibration and can move on

79
00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:31.103
If the signal corresponds to a different number boxes then you have to consider the ECG in the context of a non-standard caliber

80
00:04:32.895 --> 00:04:34.687
Now we come to heart rate

81
00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.527
A normal heart rate is between 60 and 100 beats per minute

82
00:04:38.783 --> 00:04:41.087
Although many people drop below 60 when they sleep

83
00:04:41.855 --> 00:04:44.415
Highly-trained athletes may have a normal heart rate in the 50

84
00:04:45.183 --> 00:04:49.279
Most arrhythmia will cause a patient's heart to drastically slow down or speed up

85
00:04:49.535 --> 00:04:53.375
So determining the heart rate is crucial for ruling in or ruling out arrhythmia

86
00:04:54.143 --> 00:04:57.215
A heart rate below 60 beats per minute is called bradycardia

87
00:04:57.727 --> 00:05:00.543
And a heart rate above 100 beats per minute is called tachycardia

88
00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:06.431
There are a ton of ways to determine heart rate and most require complex math and formulas

89
00:05:06.943 --> 00:05:10.015
We're going to make your life easy and give you the two quick-and-dirty ways

90
00:05:10.527 --> 00:05:13.343
That way when your attending hands when usage and ask for the rate

91
00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.183
You can answer in seconds rather than whipping out scrap paper and working through formulas

92
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:21.791
These methods give you more of an approximation than exact heart rate

93
00:05:22.303 --> 00:05:24.095
The doctors really need to know exact rates

94
00:05:24.351 --> 00:05:26.143
Estimates will almost always suffice

95
00:05:26.911 --> 00:05:33.055
Sing the heart rate is approximately 82 beats per minute when is actually 84 beats per minute will not have clinical implications

96
00:05:34.335 --> 00:05:39.199
The first method is called the 300 150-175 6050 roll

97
00:05:39.711 --> 00:05:42.527
That's a mouthful some refer to this as the 300 method

98
00:05:43.807 --> 00:05:46.623
You count a large boxes in between consecutive Beats

99
00:05:47.135 --> 00:05:52.511
You can use P wave to P wave are we too are wave or any other end of all that corresponds to one full cycle

100
00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:58.399
If there's only one large box between two consecutive beats then they will be 300 beats in 1 minute

101
00:05:59.167 --> 00:06:03.775
If there are two large boxes between consecutive beats than the rate is 150 beats per minute

102
00:06:04.543 --> 00:06:06.847
3 large boxes means a hundred beats per minute

103
00:06:07.103 --> 00:06:09.663
4 large boxes mean 75 beats per minute

104
00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:11.967
5 large boxes mean 60 beats per minute

105
00:06:12.223 --> 00:06:14.527
And 6 large boxes means 50 beats per minute

106
00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.391
Hence the name 300 150 175 60 50 rule

107
00:06:19.903 --> 00:06:23.487
Feel free to look at the derivation of these numbers but we don't think it's worth including here

108
00:06:25.023 --> 00:06:26.047
Not for the second method

109
00:06:26.815 --> 00:06:28.607
The Rhythm strips are 10 seconds long

110
00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:31.423
If you count the number of beats within the Rhythm strip

111
00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:33.727
Then you know how many beats are per 10 seconds

112
00:06:34.495 --> 00:06:38.079
Simply multiply this number by 6 to get the number of beats per 60 Seconds

113
00:06:38.335 --> 00:06:39.103
Heart beats per minute

114
00:06:40.127 --> 00:06:41.919
If there are 12 beats on the Rhythm strip

115
00:06:42.175 --> 00:06:44.735
The heart rate is approximately 72 beats per minute

116
00:06:46.015 --> 00:06:52.159
This method is especially useful when the heart rhythm is a regular which can be a pathological or normal variation between beats that occur

117
00:06:52.415 --> 00:06:55.487
Occurs with inspiration expiration which is called sinus arrhythmia

118
00:06:57.023 --> 00:06:58.047
Let's look at this example

119
00:06:58.815 --> 00:06:59.839
Will determine the heart rate

120
00:07:00.095 --> 00:07:02.399
Using both methods so you get some practice

121
00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:05.471
Let's start by using the 300 method

122
00:07:06.239 --> 00:07:08.799
Let's choose this one as a starting point

123
00:07:09.055 --> 00:07:11.103
Because the r-wave is almost exactly on the line

124
00:07:12.127 --> 00:07:13.407
As you can see here

125
00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:16.991
There's just under 5 large boxes between consecutive Beats

126
00:07:17.503 --> 00:07:20.575
This means that the heart rate is just over 60 beats per minute

127
00:07:20.831 --> 00:07:22.367
What's a 63 beats per minute

128
00:07:23.135 --> 00:07:24.671
Now let's use the Rhythm strip method

129
00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:31.583
Account 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 QRS complex within the

130
00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:32.863
10-second Rhythm strip

131
00:07:33.375 --> 00:07:37.215
Multiplying 11 by 6 year old heart rate of 66 beats per minute

132
00:07:37.983 --> 00:07:42.591
See how quick these methods are while still yielding approximately the same answer within 3 beats per minute

133
00:07:46.943 --> 00:07:50.015
The correct answer is 130 to 140 beats per minute

134
00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:53.087
Therefore this is your first abnormal ECG

135
00:07:53.343 --> 00:07:59.487
The normal heart rate is less than 100 beats per minute heart rate of 130 to 140 beats per minute is considered

136
00:07:59.743 --> 00:08:00.511
Tachycardic

137
00:08:01.279 --> 00:08:02.815
Using the 300 method

138
00:08:03.071 --> 00:08:08.191
You can see that they are just over two large boxes between II of Beats which course monster just under

139
00:08:08.447 --> 00:08:12.031
150 beats per minute let's say 135 beats per minute

140
00:08:12.799 --> 00:08:14.847
Now using the Rhythm strip rule

141
00:08:15.615 --> 00:08:16.127
Account

142
00:08:16.383 --> 00:08:18.175
23 QRS complexes

143
00:08:19.455 --> 00:08:23.551
In the 10-second Rhythm strip which corresponds to 138 beats per minute

144
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:25.343
Rhythm

145
00:08:26.111 --> 00:08:31.487
Determining the rhythm is one of the most high-yield topics we're going to discuss both clinically and for exam purpose

146
00:08:32.767 --> 00:08:38.143
A normal rhythm is called sinus rhythm indicating that the impulses are initiated by the sinoatrial node

147
00:08:38.911 --> 00:08:39.679
For SA node

148
00:08:40.703 --> 00:08:46.591
In sinus rhythm atrial depolarization begins of the SA node and spreads in Fairly to the AV node

149
00:08:47.103 --> 00:08:48.639
Before ventricular depolarization

150
00:08:49.151 --> 00:08:51.711
So the ECG must meet the following criteria

151
00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:55.551
Every P wave is followed by QRS complex

152
00:08:56.575 --> 00:08:57.343
This shows

153
00:08:57.599 --> 00:09:00.927
All atrial impulses are transmitted through to the ventricles

154
00:09:02.719 --> 00:09:06.047
Number two is that every QRS is preceded by a p-wave

155
00:09:06.559 --> 00:09:11.423
And this shows that all ventricular impulses were triggered initially by an atrial depolarization

156
00:09:13.215 --> 00:09:17.311
And the third criteria is that the P wave is upright in Lee's one and two

157
00:09:18.335 --> 00:09:22.943
The atrial impulse initiates in the SA node at the superior portion of the right atrium

158
00:09:23.711 --> 00:09:26.015
From there it spreads both leftwards the left h

159
00:09:26.527 --> 00:09:27.295
And in Fairly

160
00:09:28.063 --> 00:09:28.831
To the AV node

161
00:09:29.343 --> 00:09:33.183
It's about the inferior leads 2 3 and avf and the left lateral leads

162
00:09:33.695 --> 00:09:34.719
1 and AVL

163
00:09:35.231 --> 00:09:38.047
Should show positive deflections during atrial depolarization

164
00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:41.375
Since the impulses traveling towards the positive end of those leads

165
00:09:42.655 --> 00:09:48.287
This is why the p waves should be upright in leads 1 and 2 if the impulse is truly originating that's a no

166
00:09:49.311 --> 00:09:50.591
This last Criterion is

167
00:09:50.847 --> 00:09:52.127
Often forgotten or ignored

168
00:09:52.895 --> 00:09:56.735
What is really required for you to assert that the ECG shows sinus rhythm

169
00:09:58.271 --> 00:10:00.319
If the heart rate is between 60 and 100

170
00:10:00.831 --> 00:10:02.367
The misses called normal sinus rhythm

171
00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:06.719
If the Rhythm follows these criteria but the rate is less than 60

172
00:10:06.975 --> 00:10:08.767
This is called sinus bradycardia

173
00:10:09.535 --> 00:10:12.607
At the rate of greater than 100 this is called sinus tachycardia

174
00:10:13.631 --> 00:10:17.215
Sinus bradycardia and sinus tachycardia are examples of arrhythmias

175
00:10:17.471 --> 00:10:19.519
Which will be discussed in detail later in the module

176
00:10:21.311 --> 00:10:22.591
Now we come to intervals

177
00:10:22.847 --> 00:10:27.455
The PR interval is the time between the beginning of the P wave in the beginning of the QRS complex

178
00:10:28.223 --> 00:10:32.063
The normal PR interval is between .12 and 20 seconds

179
00:10:32.575 --> 00:10:34.879
Which corresponds to three to five small boxes

180
00:10:35.903 --> 00:10:38.719
In this example the PR's about 5 boxes or

181
00:10:39.231 --> 00:10:39.999
.20 seconds

182
00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:44.607
The PR interval reflects atrial emptying into The ventricle

183
00:10:45.119 --> 00:10:50.239
A shorting of this interval means of the ventricles are Contracting very soon after the onset of atrial contraction

184
00:10:50.751 --> 00:10:52.287
What can happen in several arrhythmias

185
00:10:52.799 --> 00:10:55.871
Lengthening means there's an abnormally long delay

186
00:10:56.127 --> 00:10:58.431
Between atrial contraction and ventricular contraction

187
00:10:58.687 --> 00:11:00.223
Just called AV block

188
00:11:00.735 --> 00:11:03.807
Will discuss AV Block in detail in a later module

189
00:11:04.319 --> 00:11:08.927
The QRS interval is the time between the beginning and the end of the QRS complex

190
00:11:09.695 --> 00:11:11.999
The normal duration for the QRS interval

191
00:11:12.511 --> 00:11:15.071
Is less than .12 seconds or three small box

192
00:11:16.351 --> 00:11:17.631
In this example is almost

193
00:11:18.143 --> 00:11:19.423
Exactly 3 small box

194
00:11:21.215 --> 00:11:27.359
The QRS should be nice and crisp to ensure that the ventricles are Contracting as a unit to maximize pumping efficiency

195
00:11:28.383 --> 00:11:33.759
There's nothing that really causes a short in the QRS but many things can cause a lengthening of the QRS interval

196
00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:38.879
QRS duration can be affected by conduction delays of the his purkinje bundle

197
00:11:39.391 --> 00:11:40.927
As well as electrolyte imbalances

198
00:11:41.695 --> 00:11:45.279
Is relatively common for a patient to have a left or right bundle branch block

199
00:11:45.791 --> 00:11:48.095
And this block in the conducting pathway of the ventricles

200
00:11:48.351 --> 00:11:50.399
Muse the takes longer for the ventricles

201
00:11:50.655 --> 00:11:53.471
Chicken track entirely which lengthens the QRS duration

202
00:11:54.495 --> 00:12:00.639
The QT interval with the time between the beginning of the QRS complex and the end of the T wave so it represents the time between the big

203
00:12:00.895 --> 00:12:02.431
Beginning of ventricular depolarization

204
00:12:02.687 --> 00:12:04.735
And the end of ventricular repolarization

205
00:12:05.759 --> 00:12:07.807
If the heart rate is in the normal range you can use

206
00:12:08.063 --> 00:12:09.087
This is a shortcut

207
00:12:09.343 --> 00:12:15.487
If the QT interval is normal if it is less than half of the interval between two consecutive QRS complexes

208
00:12:16.767 --> 00:12:18.815
The QT interval is affected by heart rate

209
00:12:19.583 --> 00:12:23.935
The QT interval is shorter if the heart rate is faster and is longer if heart rate is slower

210
00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:27.263
Therefore the QT interval must be corrected for heart rate

211
00:12:27.775 --> 00:12:30.079
This corrected value is known as the QTC

212
00:12:30.591 --> 00:12:33.151
QTC is calculated by Bizet formula

213
00:12:33.407 --> 00:12:39.295
Dividing the Cutie duration by the square root of the RR interval which of the time between consecutive are waves

214
00:12:40.575 --> 00:12:41.855
The normal QTC

215
00:12:42.111 --> 00:12:43.647
Is less than or equal to

216
00:12:43.903 --> 00:12:45.183
.44 seconds

217
00:12:46.719 --> 00:12:51.327
As a quick conceptual point you should know that the QRS duration does not change with heart rate

218
00:12:51.583 --> 00:12:53.887
Because ventricular contraction is a fixed entity

219
00:12:54.655 --> 00:12:57.471
If the heart wants to speed up it will shorten ventricular filling

220
00:12:57.727 --> 00:13:00.287
But it will not shorten ventricular contraction time

221
00:13:01.567 --> 00:13:04.639
The truck here shows three important information about intervals

222
00:13:05.151 --> 00:13:07.711
Most of ECG interpretation is conceptual

223
00:13:07.967 --> 00:13:10.527
But intervals are one thing that you might want to memorize

224
00:13:13.599 --> 00:13:16.671
Finally we come to the mean QRS axis

225
00:13:17.439 --> 00:13:23.327
Mean QRS axis represents the average direction of electrical forces during ventricular contraction

226
00:13:24.351 --> 00:13:28.447
Although understanding me access is necessary for Proficiency in interpreting ECG

227
00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:32.799
It is relatively low yield for exam purposes so we will keep this discussion brief

228
00:13:33.823 --> 00:13:37.919
We already introduced the axial reference system when we discuss the limb leads earlier

229
00:13:38.431 --> 00:13:39.199
With this in mind

230
00:13:39.711 --> 00:13:43.039
A normal axis is from negative 30 degrees to positive 90

231
00:13:44.575 --> 00:13:48.671
If the axis is less than -30 degrees you have left axis deviation

232
00:13:49.439 --> 00:13:53.279
At the axis is greater than positive 90° then you have write Access TV

233
00:13:55.583 --> 00:14:00.703
Let me start out by saying that mean QRS axis is determined by looking only at the limb leads

234
00:14:00.959 --> 00:14:02.751
Just leave can be ignored for this park

235
00:14:03.519 --> 00:14:06.591
Also access is only related to the QRS complex

236
00:14:06.847 --> 00:14:08.383
Sonor p-wave and t-wave

237
00:14:09.151 --> 00:14:13.503
You should also know that isoelectric lines are perpendicular to the direction of the lead

238
00:14:15.295 --> 00:14:17.087
First look at the QRS of Lead 1

239
00:14:17.599 --> 00:14:22.463
Lead 1.20 degrees so it's isoelectric line would be vertical

240
00:14:23.743 --> 00:14:26.559
If the QRS complex is mostly in the positive direction

241
00:14:26.815 --> 00:14:29.119
The axis is anywhere in the Shaded region

242
00:14:29.887 --> 00:14:33.215
Now you have to look at lead 2 which runs towards positive 60-degree

243
00:14:33.983 --> 00:14:36.287
Therefore it's isoelectric line is right here

244
00:14:37.311 --> 00:14:41.919
If the QRS complex in lead II is mostly positive than the axes anywhere in this shade

245
00:14:42.943 --> 00:14:46.783
Therefore if the QRS is positive in both Lead 1 and Lead 2

246
00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:49.343
Let me access will fall within the region of overlap

247
00:14:49.599 --> 00:14:52.671
Which is exactly from negative 30 degrees deposit 90 degrees

248
00:14:53.439 --> 00:14:55.231
This would be a normal axis

249
00:14:56.511 --> 00:15:00.863
Now what if lead one has a positive QRS but lead to has a negative QRS

250
00:15:01.631 --> 00:15:03.423
We won't stay the same cuz it's still positive

251
00:15:04.447 --> 00:15:08.031
But now you would say the opposite side of the isoelectric line of lead to

252
00:15:08.543 --> 00:15:11.615
In this case the reason of overlap is less than -30 degrees

253
00:15:11.871 --> 00:15:16.735
Therefore if lead one is positive and lead to is negative you have left axis deviation

254
00:15:18.527 --> 00:15:19.295
Next

255
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:21.855
What if lead 1 is negative and leave two is positive

256
00:15:23.391 --> 00:15:26.463
You would say the left side of the isoelectric line for Lead 1

257
00:15:26.975 --> 00:15:30.047
You would shade the positive side of the isoelectric line of lead to

258
00:15:30.815 --> 00:15:32.095
Now the overlap is here

259
00:15:32.351 --> 00:15:33.631
Which is further positive

260
00:15:33.887 --> 00:15:35.167
Then positive 90 degrees

261
00:15:36.447 --> 00:15:41.055
Therefore when the QRS is negative in Lead 1 and positive and lead to you have write access

262
00:15:41.311 --> 00:15:41.823
Deviation

263
00:15:43.615 --> 00:15:46.431
Finally what if lead one and lead two are both negative

264
00:15:46.687 --> 00:15:52.831
You would say the left side of the isoelectric line for Lead 1 and the negative side of the isoelectric line for lead to

265
00:15:53.599 --> 00:15:55.391
The region of overlap is out here

266
00:15:56.415 --> 00:15:58.719
You can form one extra step in the circumstance

267
00:15:59.999 --> 00:16:02.559
Look at lead avf which point straight downward

268
00:16:02.815 --> 00:16:04.607
So the isoelectric line is horizontal

269
00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:11.007
If the QRS complex is mostly positive in the region of overlap for all three leads would be here

270
00:16:11.775 --> 00:16:15.871
This is greater than positive 90° so we would call this right Axis deviation

271
00:16:16.895 --> 00:16:19.967
If the QRS complex in lead avf is mostly negative

272
00:16:20.223 --> 00:16:24.831
The region of overlap is up here in no-man's-land and you call this indeterminate Acts

273
00:16:27.135 --> 00:16:30.975
Left axis deviation commonly occurs in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy

274
00:16:31.999 --> 00:16:34.559
If the left ventricle has a thicker myocardium than usual

275
00:16:34.815 --> 00:16:37.887
I mean overall electrical forces will be skewed towards the left

276
00:16:38.143 --> 00:16:39.679
And you'll have left axis deviation

277
00:16:40.703 --> 00:16:41.727
The same is true of the right

278
00:16:41.983 --> 00:16:45.823
If the right ventricle is enlarged asthma case of right ventricular hypertrophy

279
00:16:46.079 --> 00:16:51.711
Then the overall electrical forces during ventricular contraction be skewed to the right and you will have right Axis deviation

280
00:16:52.223 --> 00:16:54.271
I can make access extremely simple

281
00:16:54.783 --> 00:16:57.855
If the QRS complex in Lead 1 and 2 are primarily

282
00:16:58.111 --> 00:17:00.159
Positive deflection Stony axis is normal

283
00:17:01.183 --> 00:17:03.743
If lead 1 is positive believe to is negative

284
00:17:04.255 --> 00:17:05.791
Then you have left axis deviation

285
00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:10.143
If lead one is negative but leave to is positive than you have right Axis deviation

286
00:17:11.423 --> 00:17:14.751
If we wanted me to or both negative then you look at a BF

287
00:17:15.263 --> 00:17:21.151
If ever you have positive than your right Axis deviation and if a BF is negative you have an indeterminate axis

288
00:17:22.943 --> 00:17:28.319
Now you've learned the standard sequence of ECG interpretation including calibration rate

289
00:17:28.575 --> 00:17:30.623
Rhythm intervals in Access

290
00:17:31.903 --> 00:17:36.511
In future modules we will be introducing all of the abnormalities that you may find on ECG

291
00:17:37.279 --> 00:17:41.375
Please keep the basics in mind and always go through the entire progression of interpretation
